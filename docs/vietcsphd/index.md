# Guide for International Students to apply to a CS Ph.D. program in the US



## Grades and Test Scores
> For a Ph.D. in CS , these are somewhat important because you have to meet certain minimum to be considered. Having a good GPA from a *well-known* school helps!  But other than that, other documents including ref letters and your statement are much more important. 


- GPA: at least 3.0 in your BS
  - but also consider the rank/prestige of your schools (**if** we know about it)
- GRE: not required
  - most CS graduate programs no longer require GRE
- English requirement tests
  - TOEF: 88 pts in total AND >= 20 points in each subsection
  - IELTS: >= 6.5
  - DuoLingo Graduate English: >= 120
  - Pearson Test of Academic English: >= 67

## Recommendation or Reference Letters
> This letter is very important.  It can signficantly hurt or help your application.  So pay very careful attention to these letters


## Statement
> Your statement determines your research potential. It is perhaps the most important part of the application. Ph.D. admission committee reads it carefully. Make it as good as you can. 

- **Do not**
  - put in the wrong university or professors' names.  If you're applying to university X, and then at the end talk about how good university Y is or how you would like to work a professor at university Y. 
  - Talk about your childhood dream, unless it is true and unique.
