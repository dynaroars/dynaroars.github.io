# Guide for International Students to apply to a CS Ph.D. program in the US


## Statement
> Your statement determines your research potential. It is perhaps the most important part of the application. Ph.D. admission committee reads it carefully. Make it as good as you can. 

- Pay attention to some of these details
  - Double check for wrong university or professors' names.  It will not look good if you're applying to university `X`, and then at the end talk about how good university `Y` is or how you would like to work a professor at university `Y`.
  - Do not talk about your childhood dream, unless it is true and unique. And even if it is, we don't really care much unless it is very very unique somehow.  Focus on experience and accomplishment that show you can do research.
   
## Recommendation or Reference Letters
> This letter is very important.  It can signficantly hurt or help your application.  So pay very careful attention to these letters

It is likely that we do not know your school or your professor. 



## Grades and Test Scores
> For a Ph.D. in CS , these are somewhat important because you have to meet certain minimum to be considered. Having a good GPA from a *well-known* school helps!  But other than that, other documents including ref letters and your statement are much more important. 


- GPA: at least 3.0 in your BS
  - but also consider the rank/prestige of your schools (**if** we know about it)
- GRE: not required
  - most CS graduate programs no longer require GRE
- English requirement tests
  - TOEF: 88 pts in total AND >= 20 points in each subsection
  - IELTS: >= 6.5
  - DuoLingo Graduate English: >= 120
  - Pearson Test of Academic English: >= 67
