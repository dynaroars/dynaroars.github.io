\title{Demystifying the Computer Science Ph.D. Admission in the US}
\date{}

%\setcounter{secnumdepth}{3}
\begin{document}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Having been involved in PhD admissions for many years and after
numerious interaction international (especially Vietnamese) students, I've
realized that international students lack a clear understanding of
the Computer Science PhD admission process at US universities. This confusion not only
discourages students from applying but also creates the perception that
getting accepted is difficult compared to CS PhD programs in other countries.

So I want to share my opinions and advice for those who are interested in applying for a \textbf{PhD in Computer Science in the US}.
While I wrote this document for CS applicants, it should be applicable to various STEM fields.
Moreover, while many examples given are for GMU, which is ranked 33rd on CSRankings (June 2016), the writing should be generalize to most other R1 universities  (though \emph{very} top schools migh be very extreme, e.g., see the admission process at \href{https://da-data.blogspot.com/2015/03/reflecting-on-cs-graduate-admissions.html}{CMU}.

I wish you the best of luck. And if you follow these advice,
you will at least have a good chance at GMU (see
\href{https://github.com/dynaroars/dynaroars.github.io/wiki/About-GMU}{why
you want to study at GMU}). Happy hunting!

If you have suggestions or comments, feel free to create a \href{https://github.com/dynaroars/dynaroars.github.io/issues}{GitHub issue} for discussion.
\end{abstract}

\section{Should You Apply?}


First, I want to emphasize that PhD students in Computer
Science \emph{do not} need to worry about funding, especially at R1
universities in the US. If you are admitted, you will almost certainly
receive \emph{full funding} to support your study, including tuition,
health insurance, and 9-month stipend. Moreover, depending on the university,
you may even receive additional benefits like summer salary. Note that
funding is typically more available for PhD students than 
Masters. % [[#funding][Read more about funding here]]

\begin{tcolorbox}[left=1pt,right=1pt,top=1pt,bottom=1pt]
Vu: At GMU, in addition to the usual tuition waiving and health insurance,
admitted students are guaranteed with a GTA stipend (graduate teaching
assistantship) which is \$28K/9-month for 4 years and a 3-month summer
salary (\$9K, so about \$37K first year).
\end{tcolorbox}

Second, I believe that applying to a good US university \emph{should not} be any
harder than at good schools in other countries. If you think you have a
chance at schools in other countries, e.g., South Korea, Singapore, Germany, UK, Japan and Australia, then you surely have a chance in
the US as well.

\begin{tcolorbox}[left=1pt,right=1pt,top=1pt,bottom=1pt]
Vu: One of the reasons I create this post is that several of my colleagues are interested in 
recruiting Vietnamese students and were surprised when seeing very few Vietnamese applications (compared to other countries). In general the number of
PhD applications from Vietnam to US universities is very low and  more would be very welcomed. 
\end{tcolorbox}

%% Vu: *what's a PhD?*  This [[https://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/][series of pictures]] from [[https://matt.might.net][Matt Might]] illustrates what a PhD means.
%% \end{tcolorbox}


\section{How is your application evaluated?}

After you submit your PhD application (usually in mid-December), it will be first screened
for general requirements, e.g., did you submit your transcripts and standard scores? did your writters submit their letters?
Then your application will be reviewed by a
\textbf{PhD admission committee} consisting of faculty members in CS. Each application is reviewed by about three faculty members, who will evaluate your profile and try to reach a consensus about your case.

It is worth noting that most PhD committee members are \textbf{new assistant professors}. This is designed to give junior faculty, who typically don't have students yet, the opportunities to recruit students. The chair of the committee will be a tenured/senior faculty, but they will not review applicaitions and instead assign them to committee members. The chair will look for keywords/interests, e.g., research areas or mentioning faculty names, and assign the application to appropriate faculty. 

\begin{tcolorbox}[left=1pt,right=1pt,top=1pt,bottom=1pt]
Vu: At GMU, we usually decide that a candidate is either (i) accepted with funding (TA or RA) or (ii) rejected. In other words, in most cases, we either
accept you with full funding, or we don't. In some rare cases, we may accept
you with no funding because you have funding on your own (e.g., you are
supported by your government or have external grants). Also, we justify
our decision with a short summary about your application. In this summary note we list
strengths (e.g., well-known undergrad school) and weaknesses (e.g., weak
LORs).
\end{tcolorbox}

\paragraph{Q: why we do not waive application fee?}  A common question many students have (I believe \$100 at GMU). First, without application fee, we will have \textbf{too many} to applications to review.  Second, by having to pay the application fee, students would be more serious about their application (in a sense, this will filter non-serious people).

\section{Application}\label{sec:application}

The primary focus of the admissions committee is to \textbf{evaluate your background and interest in research} since a PhD in Computer Science
is a research degree. To assess your research capability, we consider
the following key indicators.

\subsection{Research Ability}

The most effective evidence of research ability is having \textbf{published papers in reputable international conferences or journals}.
Having published good papers is a sign that the applicant was involved in research.

It's important to aim for the top conferences in your field, which you can
find on places such as CSRankings~\cite{csrankings}, designed specifically to help CS PhD
applicants. Local conferences and non-English journals or conferences do
not carry as much weight since their quality is often unknown to US
faculty.

However, I understand that many international students do not have the opportunities to publish in top places, so general IEEE/ACM/USENIX confs/journals would suffice.  But be sure to talk about it in your \hyperref[sec:research-statement]{statement}.

\begin{tcolorbox}[left=1pt,right=1pt,top=1pt,bottom=1pt]
Vu: Vietnamese students often mention Scopus Q1, which consists of diversed journals from IEEE, Elsevier, and several other publishers unfamiliar to me.  Honestly, I don't know/recognize the majority of journals listed in Scopus Q1. So this might be something to be mindful of, as the CS PhD Admission committee may not be familiar with your papers, so devote sometime in your statement to discuss their significance.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[left=1pt,right=1pt,top=1pt,bottom=1pt]
Craig: GMU and many other universities allow you to upload your published papers. In many cases, even if the papers were not published at top places, we can still determine their quality by simply skimming over the paper.  
\end{tcolorbox}

Additionally, \textbf{work or internship experiences at renowned research laboratories}, such as Microsoft Research, can significantly strengthen your
application.  Unfortunately, many good international research places, e.g., VinAI in Vietnam, remain relatively unknown to most universities in the US. So do not assume US faculty know about them, i.e., you should explicit say something about them in your statement.

Finally, \textbf{participating internationally recognized competitions} can also demonstrate your research potential.
For example, participating in Math Olympiads if you want to do theory or  winning ACM programming contests if you want to ``build'' stuff, e.g., software analysis.


\subsection{Letters of Recommendation (LORs)}

Most CS PhD applications will require at least 2 LORs. Having a letter from an internationally recognized researcher can
greatly strengthen your application. However, obtaining such letters
can be challenging for international students. So it is acceptable to have a letter from any professor
that knows you well enough to talk about \emph{your specific research experience and capabilities}.


Many students have letters written by the applicants themselves and signed by their professors. These have little
values (we can easily recognize them) and will consider them weakness.
Similarly, many professors write very generic letters for students (a common example is that the students didn't do any
research or make any impression for the professor to write about). These
letters are also not useful and considered weak.

Many students get letters from someone from company where they did internship or are
working at. It is OK as long as it is a research-based personalized
letter (once again, we are talking about PhD applications, not MS).


\begin{tcolorbox}[left=1pt,right=1pt,top=1pt,bottom=1pt]
Vu: For me personally, it's better to have a good personalized
letter about your own research ability from someone who is less
well-known than a generic/weak letter from a well-known person.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Research Statement}\label{sec:research-statement}

While you might not be able to get good LORs or change
\hyperref[sec:your-school]{where your go to school}, you have control of your
statement! So write it well because we *will* take it seriously.
A well-written LOR also shows that you can communicate, which is very important in research. Moreover, it
is important because if you need (GTA) funding, it will provide evidence
that you can teach and communicate with students.

There are many guides on writing research statement, e.g.,~\cite{blattman2022writing},
so I will not talk too much about it. In short, convince us that you can
do research through your experience, e.g., published papers, or if you work on some projects by yourself, talk about it.

Finally, this is something very easy to do, but is missed by many
applicants: \textbf{customize the statement} for the school you're applying to,
e.g., why do you apply there ? name several professors who you're
interested in working with (in some cases your application will be sent to them for evaluation).
Be careful not to send wrong statement to wrong school or mixing
facts (e.g., talking about school X but mentioned about working with
profs. at school Y; and definitely do not talk about George Washington when applying to George Mason). I have seen such statements more time that I
should.


\begin{tcolorbox}[left=1pt,right=1pt,top=1pt,bottom=1pt]
Vu: I always read the research statement first and then LORs. If I am
persuaded by then, I would skim over other factors and advocate for
acceptance (unless I see red flags in other parts). If I am not
convinced, then I will likely recommend rejection (unless I see
something standout in other parts).
\end{tcolorbox}


\subsection{Your School}\label{sec:your-school}

Graduating from top universities \emph{that we recognize} helps (but still not as much as having research experience).
However, committee members might not know much about schools in your country and just treat your school as
\emph{``unknown foreign''}, which can be a minus point (if your school is well-known, then it is \emph{``top foreign''}, which is definitely a plus).

So what can you do about this? several things such as ask your CS dept to put itself on CSRankings (it's the easiest way to get CS people to know about the school), explain about your school in your statement (and ask your LOR writer to do that), and of course, if you're Vietnamese, consider a CS PhD program that has \href{https://github.com/dynaroars/dynaroars.github.io/wiki/Viet-CS-Profs-US}{Vietnamese professors}.

\begin{tcolorbox}[left=1pt,right=1pt,top=1pt,bottom=1pt]
Vu: Sometime PhD admission committee will share a document such as \href{https://github.com/dynaroars/dynaroars.github.io/wiki/Foreign-Top-Schools}{this one}, which lists the top schools in several countries. I have looked at Vietnamese applications (whether they are assigned to me or not) and provide inputs to the reviews of those applications, e.g., X is the top tech school in Vietnam and so it should be /top/ instead of /unknown/ foreign, which makes a huge difference.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Grades/GREs}\label{sec:grades}
Having good grades is important (but not as important as research experience).
However, in general, unless your school is well-known, having top grades/ranks
usually will not help. This is simply because we cannot evaluate them.

This can be an issue for students in many international top universities 
where the competition is so high that very good students students can still have low ranking (and be overlooked by Admission committee).
So what to do with this? well, same as \hyperref[sec:your-school]{before}, e.g., put a note about this in your statement.

Note that while having good grades at unknown school might not help,
having very bad grades will be \red{red flag} (unless your LORs or
statements give proper explanation). This is especially true if you
have bad grades in relevant courses.

\paragraph{GRE} Most CS programs in the US \emph{no longer require GREs}, so you don't need to
take them unless you think it will help prove something. You do need to
take standarized English test. Just do well enough to pass minimum
requirement set by the university.

\begin{tcolorbox}[left=1pt,right=1pt,top=1pt,bottom=1pt]
Vu: The minimum for GMU CS (being above this might not mean much, but below this is a \red{red flag}).
\begin{itemize}
\item GPA: $\ge 3.0$ in your undergrad
  \begin{itemize}
  \item but also consider the rank/prestige of your schools
  \end{itemize}
\item GRE: not required
  \begin{itemize}  
    \item most CS graduate programs no longer require GRE
    \item but if you want to use it, then we expect a total (V+Q) of $\ge 311$ (with a $\ge 157$ Q) and A $\ge 3.0-3.5$.
  \end{itemize}      
\item English requirement tests (one of the below)
  \begin{itemize}    
  \item TOEF: 88 pts in total AND $\ge 20$ points in each subsection OR
  \item IELTS: $\ge 6.5$ OR
  \item DuoLingo Graduate English: $\ge 120$ OR 
  \item Pearson Test of Academic English: $\ge 67$
  \end{itemize}  
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}


\subsection{CV/Resume}
This should be a summary of the accomplishments of the applicant.  I would quickly scan this document to see if something stand out (e.g., Publications, Programming Competition Awards, Teaching Experiences).

\subsection{Interview}

Sometime a faculty wants to interview an applicant to make a decision. Typically this means they lean toward accepting you (if we don't like your application, we will not bother doing the interview).

An interview lasts about 20--30 mins, and one implicit thing you will be evaluated on is whether you can communicate effectively (i.e., speak/understand English).  You will also get chance to ask questions about the university so think of something to ask (just the same as you interview at a company).

\begin{tcolorbox}[left=1pt,right=1pt,top=1pt,bottom=1pt]
At GMU, we are encouraged to interview candidates. In most cases we interview very strong candidates, i.e., the interview is actually to recruit them.  In some rare cases a faculty interviews a candidate that they see potentials and want argue for acceptance, i.e., without the interview, that candidate is definitely rejected. In any case, getting interview means you have a very good chance of getting accepted.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Getting Accepted and Choosing the Right School}

Around March you should hear back from most PhD programs that you applied (if not, send email and ask). You will have to make your decision by around April 15.
If you have offers, congratulations!  Now you're at a different game because the schools that accept you will now try to get you to accept them!  

Most schools will have an \textbf{Open House}, which is a great resource to learn about the dept, faculty, area, etc. During the Open House, you get a chance to talk directly to multiple faculty and current students.  Take notes of faculty who make you excited, count those that are taking in new students (if they meet you, likely they are considering new students!).  Talk to students about their advisors, the dept, the area, funding situation etc.  Ask about anything you want to determine that they deserve \emph{you}.

In short, if you can come to the Open House, do come.  But if you're international student outside of the US, then likely you cannot come.  So see if you can attend it virtually and ask to meet with individual faculty if you can.

\begin{tcolorbox}[left=1pt,right=1pt,top=1pt,bottom=1pt]
GMU has Virtual Open House, e.g., \url{https://cs-gmu.github.io/cs-phd-voh-s23/}, which I've co-organized in the last two years. We invite all accepted PhD students to the VOH to learn about the CS program, the department, GMU, and the DC area in general. Students also get opportunies to chat with professors and current students.  Everything is through Zoom.
\end{tcolorbox}



\section{Funding}

As mentioned, if you're admitted to a \emph{good} CS PhD program, you should not have to worry about funding!  
In the US, the common types of funding for PhD (in any fields) are \emph{graduate teaching assistant} (GTA or TA), \emph{graduate research assistant} (GRA or RA), and \emph{Fellowship}.
RA is the type of funding paid by a prof. for you to do research. TA is paid by the department for you to help with teaching. Finally, fellowship is an independent type of funding that can come from a company, organization, or even the university.
Tab.~\ref{tab:funding} summarizes the differences.

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \caption{Different types of fundings}\label{tab:funding}
  \begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}
    \toprule
    &\textbf{TA}&\textbf{RA}&\textbf{Fellowship}\\
    \midrule
    \textbf{From} & School & Profs. & School/External\\
    \textbf{For}                  & Teaching Assistant       & Research                        & Research                              \\
    \textbf{Tuition/Ins./Stipend} & Yes                      & Yes                             & Yes                                   \\
    \textbf{Cover Summer?}              & No                       & Maybe                           & Yes                                   \\
    \midrule
    \textbf{Pros}                 & Research Freedom         & Get to do research              & Research Freedom                      \\
    \textbf{Cons}                 & TA, Uncertain            & Research restriction, Uncertain & Competitive, limited             \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Graduating Assistantship (TA/RA)}
The most common type of funding is \textbf{graduate assistanship}, which is either TA or RA. Both TA and RA come with
\begin{itemize}
\item Tuition waiver
\item Health insurance: in the US, having insurance is a must!
\item Stipend: your salary
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The amount of stipend depends on the university, which in turns depend on location (e.g., a stipend in Washington DC is likely higher than in Lincoln, Nebraska due to higher living cost)
  \item Because a school year is (typically) 9-month in the US, so stipend is for 9 months (so divide by 9 for each month)
  \item You have to pay tax on your stipend (you have to pay tax for almost every source of income in the US)
  \item Private universities might pay more for stipend
  \end{itemize}
\item Some universities also pay insurance for spouse/chilren (or give very good discount)
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[left=1pt,right=1pt,top=1pt,bottom=1pt]
At GMU, TA and RA have similiar benefits in tuition waiving and insurance.  For stipend, depending on the college and department, a 9-month graduate assistant stipend is set.  TA and RA will usually be that ammount (TA will definitely be that, RA might flunctuate a bit depending on the stage of the student and the prof.). 
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Teaching Assistant (TA)}
\begin{itemize}
\item is paid through the department
\item helps with teaching class (typically grading)
\item works with various courses and professors (not necessary their advisor)
\item typically no summer because no school
\item \textbf{How to get it}  when you apply, you state that you want finnancial assistant or something similar. The PhD committee will either accept you (and give you GTA), or reject you; i.e., we do not accept a student without supporting them.
\item \textbf{Thought}: GTA is common in the beginning, when you haven't found your advisor.  But even if you get GRA, you should do GTA at least a semester or two, just to see how teaching is like (and very helpful if you're interested in an academc career).
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[left=1pt,right=1pt,top=1pt,bottom=1pt]
At GMU CS, students admitted with TA have  4 years of GTA guaranteed and also receive  stipend for the \textbf{first} summer.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Research Assistant (RA)}
\begin{itemize}
\item is paid through a professor (typically your advisor)
\item works with a professor on a research project
\item summer is possible, depending on the prof.
\item *How to get it*?  The common scenario is that you get accepted with TA, and then after a year or two find an advisor who has RA to support you. In some rare (and very lucky) cases you already know some profs  and that prof. will give you RA right away when you start.
\item *Thought*: This is the *most* common type of funding!  It is also ideal because you don't have to teach and so can focus on your research.
\end{itemize}


\begin{tcolorbox}[left=1pt,right=1pt,top=1pt,bottom=1pt]
If you're lucky and got recruited by a prof. who would give you RA right away, it's very likely you will get accepted.  For example, if a prof., even if not in PhD admissin committee, wants to work with and funds you, the PhD admission committee will respect that decision and just accept your application (unless you have many terrible red flags in your application).
\end{tcolorbox}

** Fellowship
- Another kind of funding is *fellowship*, in which the student applies from an external source (e.g., industries, government). 
- Fellowships are typically very competitive and generous, and gives pretty much all benefits tuition/insurance that a school assistantship has.  Moreover, it often gives higher stipend (including summer).
  - Typically 3-5 years
  - Examples of fellowships typically for international students are those from companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Facebook.
- *Thought*: Fellowship is prestigious, and you will stand out if you get one.  Not only you save your advisor lots of money yearly, it looks really good on your resume.  Every PhD student has pubs, but only superstars have NSF grad or Meta fellowship (in fact, these are so prestigious that even if you didn't get it but make it to the final round, school will still mention you on their website and you still should put it on your CV).


\begin{tcolorbox}[left=1pt,right=1pt,top=1pt,bottom=1pt]
At GMU, every Ph.D. applicant is automatically eligible for a *Presidential Fellowship*.  It is at least as good as GTA but the most important thing is that as a fellowship it is trully free money (i.e., you are not depending on any prof. or TA duties).  PhD admission committee members nominate applicants for this fellowship and the whole committee will vote and give the fellowship to the top 2.

# - Asking professors if they can get in or if they take students.\\
#   > Many international students will write professors asking if they can
#   get in, or if they are taking students. Unlikely anyone will reply to
#   such email because the short answer is we simply cannot evaluate your
#   profile ourselves, it needs to go to the whole committee as explained.
#   Even if a professor is seeking for students (almost everyone is
#   looking for good students), they simply cannot take one in without
#   going through the application process.


# - See this link for a large list of [[https://github.com/dynaroars/dynaroars.github.io/wiki/Funding][funding sources for PhD students]]

# ** Self-funded
# - Some PhD students are funded through their company
#   - The students work full time for the company and do their PhD part-time
#   - Typically will take longer (because you have to work full time) and require some serious committement from the students

# - Some PhD students are funded through country, e.g., GMU has several students from Saudi Arabia that are funded through their government.

# ** Others  
# - There are also various kind of one-time thing and small awards from industry or organization, e.g., a $2000 award for the summer.
Unlike the B.A., where you or your parents pay many tens of thousands of dollars,
or the M.S., where you typically work as a teaching assistant and possibly continue
to pay many tens of thousands of dollars, the Ph.D. is a time where funding is not a
concern to you. At most schools, you will not pay tuition during the time that you
are getting a Ph.D.. Typically, you will also receive a living stipend – on the order
of $2000 per month, from which you will pay your living expenses. Ideally, your
only responsibility will be research. This is called doing an RAship (Research
Assistantship).
The Ph.D. is a tremendous opportunity. You get to pick an advisor in any re-
search area you like and then you get to do research in that area, receive mentoring,
think deeply on problems, publish papers, become famous, while paying zero tu-
ition for 6 years and receiving a salary. Your advisor is paying for this opportunity
by writing grant proposals to companies and to the government to ask for fund-
ing. A single graduate student can cost an advisor upwards of 80K per year (given
the cost of tuition, the stipend, the overhead tax charged by the school, cost of
equipment and physical space, etc.).
Important note 1: At most schools, you can only do an RAship if you have
an advisor who has funding for you. Since some advisors don’t apply for grants
or are in areas which aren’t well-funded, you may have to work as a teaching
assistant every semester to get your stipend. This is called a TAship (Teaching
Assistantship). When I was a graduate student, I had a few friends who were
forced to TA 13 semesters, to fund their way through school! Alternatively, you
will have to restrict your choice of advisors to those who have funding. At CMU,
every Ph.D. student is guaranteed a stipend plus tuition regardless of which advisor
she chooses to work with.
Important note 2: There are many companies and government organizations
which offer Graduate Fellowships for Ph.D. students. If you are lucky enough
to get one of these, they will cover most of your way through graduate school,
and you will never have to worry about whether your advisor has funding or not.
Details about graduate fellowships will be discussed in Section 4.


* Miscs/FAQs

** Is an MS degree required for admission to PhD?
- No. In fact, student with BS can get MS degree "along the way" to PhD.  However, MS can help if it gives research experience or is from a more well-known school than your undergrad institution.

** Can I apply to PhD to CS if my undergrad was in Math, Biology, Finance, ..?
- Yes, as long as you can demonstrate you are ready for CS PhD research through research experiences, LoRs, statements, etc as mentioned.

** What else can you do to increase your chance?
- Show something that makes you *stand out*, e.g., are you a female or a minority in CS (research for this on Google)? Do you participate in outreach activities that help increase diversity and inclusion in CS?  All of these are important in CS in the US.  Do you have some personal coding projects that are used by many people (e.g., hosted on GitHub, lots of stars).  Remember, also show evidence to back up your claim.



** How do I address a professor Firstname Lastname?
   - If you don't know that professor (e.g., first email contact), then use *Prof. Lastname* or *Dr. Lastname*.
     - I've seen many international students write *Prof. Firstname Lastname* or *Dr. Firstname Lastname*.  Writing like that makes it like you copy and paste the names, so no need to do so,  just Prof. or Dr. Lastname.
     - Also do not use Mr. or Mrs., or just write Firstname. May be it is OK with others but I find it a bit disrespectful.
   - As you know that prof. better and depends on their preference, you can call them by their Firstname.

# * Types of Funding for CS PhDs 






# * How does GRA work?
# While you might get a 9-month $28K GRA stipend,  your advisor typically has to budget at least twice that much.  Because they have to pay your tuitition, insurance, and overhead that the university takes.  The chart below shows that each CS GRA costs about $70K at GMU.

# - Example budget of a PhD student in CS at GMU.  Using stipend and tuition rate in 2023. Conference Registration and Travel are estimates.
# - It is also **very likely** that GMU faculty won't have to pay student tuition starting Fall 2025, when this happens then we can take out  Tuition and total cost is 46.5K.

# * Miscs

# - Asking professors if they can get in or if they take students.\\
#   > Many international students will write professors asking if they can
#   get in, or if they are taking students. Unlikely anyone will reply to
#   such email because the short answer is we simply cannot evaluate your
#   profile ourselves, it needs to go to the whole committee as explained.
#   Even if a professor is seeking for students (almost everyone is
#   looking for good students), they simply cannot take one in without
#   going through the application process.

# - How long for a CS PhD in US ? > 5-6 years on avg.

# - Does having an MS help? > It can help if the MS gives research
#   experience or is from a more well-known school than your
#   undergraduate. But not having an MS does not hurt either. Nowadays it
#   is normal for students with bachelor degrees apply directly to
#   PhD in CS.
