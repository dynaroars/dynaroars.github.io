## Types of Funding
### Grants
  - Freedom to pursue basic research

#### Where to get them?  
  - NSF
    - Has REU supplement (e.g., 16K for each NSF grant)
    - Typically has a 1 year no-cost extension
  - DARPA
  - Army/Navy/Airforce

### Contract
  - Usually have some sort of "deliverables" or report requirements
  - Doesn't give lots of freedom as other grants.

### Internal Funding
  - Start up package
    - when you join the faculty at a school (either startiong completely new assistant profs. or moving from another place)
    - Typically has GRA and Summer supports. Also funding for various other things such as equipments, conference travels. 
    - Expire after 3 years or so
    
  - University funding, e.g., "Seed" funding
    - Usually small, 20K or below, 1 or 2 years.
    - Might not support faculty summer salary
    - The goal is to help you start some project to get external funding later
    
  - Statewide Initiative / Research Center
    - Similar to University funding but usually give more, e.g., 50 K or so
    - Goal is to initiate a project or collaboration (e.g., with faculty at another school in the state) to prepare for larger external proposal
  
### Industrial/Foundation Funding  
  - Unrestricted gifts: The *best* kind of funding
    - No indirect cost: university cannot charge indirect cost to these funds
    - No expiration: you can just leave them there and use in case of emergency only
    - Can be used for much broader range of things: e.g., paying for meals for your research group
    - Can be highly competitive:  you're competing against everyone

#### Where to get them?
    - Industrial: Amazon, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc
    - Foundation: Sloan, 

## Advise
