<h3 id="orgd2119c9"><span class="section-number-3">1.1.</span> Why work with me?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If you have multiple offers from Auburn/me and e.g., Boston U, Harvard, Purdue, or USC, you might want to read David and Goliath by Malcolm Gladwell and chat with me before you turn down my offer. Because ranking systems are biased and ranks are not the sole criterion when it comes to Ph.D., rather which group do you work in? Working with me at Auburn might provide one with more resources and support to be even more successful than if he/she goes to an arbitrary group in a higher-ranked place.
Under my advising, many Auburn Ph.D. students (from a wide range of backgrounds) have published top-tier CV/ML conference papers as the first author, for their first time (e.g., Michael at CVPR 2019, Naman at CVPR 2020, Chirag at ACCV 2020, Thang at ACL 2021, Giang at NeurIPS 2021). This is doable! I believe anyone can contribute to research. All you need is a cutting-edge research topic that fits your current ability (which I can find with you) and self-motivation! :) If you indeed have strong self-motivation, I estimate you’d to publish, at least, 4 first-author papers by the end of the Ph.D.</li>
<li>Our Ph.D. program is light on coursework (only 6 courses required post-bachelor) to enable students to perform research from Day 1. If you already have an M.S. in Computer Science, you’d mostly just do research in the Ph.D. (no coursework unless you and I decide that you’d benefit from taking more courses).</li>
<li>I always support a student to intern in the summer, if that’s what they really want at that time. In fact, I have helped students secure summer internships (e.g. at Bosch, Adobe) by directly talking to companies.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Admission: Please check the admission requirements by the CSSE department at Auburn University.
</p>

<p>
Deadlines: Positions available until filled (no specific deadlines).
</p>

<p>
Due to the high volume of applications, unfortunately, I’m unable to notify every applicant, except only those who appear to be a good match.

<h3 id="orge67dac2"><span class="section-number-3">2.3.</span> About GMU</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
GMU is an R1 university in Fairfax, Virginia.  It is the youngest university in VA (<a href="https://50th.gmu.edu/">50 years</a>), but is already the largest in VA (about 38,000 students). The university is strategically located in the Northern VA and Washington DC area. It is close to NSF, DARPA, ONR, NASA, and many other (funding) agencies, and large tech companies including Amazon 2nd HQ (and soon Boeing HQ). Fairfax is one of the most diversed and richest (also most expensive) place in the US.
