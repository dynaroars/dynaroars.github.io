<p>
<b>Overview</b>:  I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at George Mason University.  My research is at the intersection of Software Engineering and Programming Languages. Most of my work focuses on program verification and analysis, invariant/specification discovery, and automatic program repair.
</p>

<p>
<b>Study and Work</b>: I was born in Saigon, Vietnam, but moved to the US at an early age. I grew up in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and did my undergraduate in Computer Science at Penn State-University Park and got my M.S. in the same field at Penn State-Harrisburg.
During my M.S., I had a couple of internships at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, DC and Lockheed Martin in New Jersey.
</p>

<p>
After my M.S., I went to the Unversity of New Mexico-Albquerque, pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science. After completing the Ph.D. in 2014 I did a postdoc at the University of Maryland-College Park, and then started a faculty career at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. In 2021 I moved to Northern Virginia and joined the faculty at George Mason University.
</p>

<p>
<b>Family and Personal</b>: Most of the time, I hang out with my wife Ha (whom I met on a Southwest flight) and three children.  I used to swim and play badminton, but now I am just too busy with work and family (though I still try to close all activity rings on my Apple Watch weekly).
