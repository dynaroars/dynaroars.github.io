  <summary>More details</summary>
  <p>I was born in Saigon, Vietnam, but moved to US at a young age and grew up in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.eecs.psu.edu">Penn State-University Park</a> and my M.S. at <a href="https://hbg.psu.edu">Penn State-Harrisburg</a>, where  I was advised by <a href="https://h3turing.cs.hbg.psu.edu/~bui/">Thang Bui</a>.
    I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the <a href="https://www.cs.unm.edu">University of New Mexico-Albuquerque</a>, where I was mentored by <a href="https://profsforrest.github.io/homepage/">Stephanie Forrest</a> and
    <a href="https://www.cs.unm.edu/~kapur">Deepak Kapur</a>, and completed a two-year postdoc at the <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu">University of Maryland-College Park</a>, working with <a href="https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~jfoster/">Jeff Foster</a> at <a href="https://plum-umd.github.io">PLUM@UMD</a>.
    Prior to joining  <a href="https://cs.gmu.edu">George Mason</a>, I was at the <a href="https://www.unl.edu">University of Nebraska-Lincoln</a>. During my grad study, I had the opportunity to intern at the <a href="https://www.nrl.navy.mil">Naval Research Laboratory</a> and <a href="https://lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/research-labs/advanced-technology-labs.html">Lockheed Martin</a>.</p>
