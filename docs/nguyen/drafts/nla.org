*** Capturing Program Semantics
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: capturing-program-semantics
    :END:

Nonlinear equalities can capture precise program semantics involving
nontrivial arithmetics. Consider the =cohendiv= integer division
algorithm below.

#+BEGIN_SRC C
  int cohendiv(int x, int y){
      // performs integer division x // y

      assert(x >= 1 && y >= 1);
      int q = 0;
      int r = x;
      int a = 0;
      int b = 0;
      while(1) {
          if(!(r>=y)) break;

          a=1;
          b=y;
          while (1){
              // l1: inferred invariants
              /*
              1. x = qy+r
              2. ay = b
              3. b <= x
              4. y <= r
              5. 0 <= q
              6. 1 <= b
              7. 1 <= y
              */

              if(!(r >= 2*b)) break;
              a = 2*a;
              b = 2*b;
          }
          r = r - b;
          q = q + a;
      }

      // l2: inferred invariants
      /*
      1. x = yq*r
      2. ay = b
      3. r <= y - 1
      4. 0 <= r
      5. r <= x
      */
      return q;
  }
#+END_SRC

DIG automatically discovers the loop invariants at =l1= and the
postconditions at =l2= shown as comments in the code. These relations
are sufficiently strong to understand the semantics and verify the
correctness of =cohendiv=. The key invariant is the nonlinear equality
=x=qy+r=, which describes the precise behavior of integer division: the
dividend =x= equals the divisor =y= times the quotient =q= plus the
remainder =r=.

The other inequalities also provide useful information for debugging.
For example, the invariants at the program exit reveal several required
properties of the remainder =r=, e.g., non-negative (=0 <= r=), at most
the dividend (=r <= x=), but strictly less than the divisor
(=r <= y - 1=).

*** Complexity Analysis
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: complexity-analysis
    :END:

Another rather surprising use of nonlinear equation is to characterize
the /exact/ computational complexity of a program, which is useful for
identifying possible security problems. Consider the problem of
determining the runtime complexity of the program =tripple= below. At
first, =tripple= appears to take =O(NMP)= due to the three nested loops.
A closer analysis shows a more precise bound =O(N+NM+P)= because the
inner most loop, which is updated each time the middle loop executes,
changes the behavior of the outer most loop.

#+BEGIN_SRC C
  int tripple(int M, int N, int P){
      assert(0 <= M);
      assert(0 <= N);
      assert(0 <= P);
       
      int t = 0; // counter variable
      int i = 0;
      int j = 0;
      int k = 0;
      while(i < N){
          j = 0;
          while(j < M){          
              j = j + 1;
              k = i;
              t++;
              while(k < P){           
                  k = k + 1;
                  t++;
              }
              i = k;
          }
          i = i + 1;
          t++;
      }
       
      /* inferred invariants
      1. M^2*N*t - M^2*P*t + M*N*P*t - M*P^2*t - M*N*t^2 + M*P*t^2 + 2*M*N*t - M*P*t + N*P*t - M*t^2 - N*t^2 - P*t^2 + t^3 + N*t - t^2 == 0
      2. 0 <= N
      3. 0 <= P 
      4. 0 <= M 
      5. N  <= t
      */

      return 0;
  }
#+END_SRC

When given this program, DIG discovers the invariants given as comments
in =tripple=. Among these, the nonlinear equality =1= is rather
interesting and complex. This invariant involves =t=, which is a ghost
variable introduced to count loop iterations.

This nonlinear equality is valid, but looks incomprehensible and quite
different than the expected bound =N+NM+P= or even =NMP=. However, when
solving this equation for =t= (finding the roots of =t=), we obtain
three solutions showing that this program has different time
complexities:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  t == 0
  t == M + P + 1
  t == N - M(P - N)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Manual analysis further shows the precondition over the inputs leading
to each complexity:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  t == 0 when N == 0
  t == P + M + 1 when N <= P
  t == N - M(P - N) when N > P
#+END_EXAMPLE

Indeed, these results represent the *exact* complexity bound of
=tripple= and are more precise than the bound =O(N+MN+P)= analyzed
above. Note that =O(N+MN+P)= is still a correct /upperbound/ of
=tripple= (e.g., when =N > P= then =O(N+NM+P) = O(N+NM)=, which is
equivalent to =O(N-M(P-N)) = O(N+MN)=).

*** Representing Sortedness and Permutation Properties
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: representing-sortedness-and-permutation-properties
    :END:

In this example we illustrate that nonlinear equalities can capture the
permutation property required for sorting numbers. DIG can infer these
nonlinear equalities and other invariants to capture both permutation
and sortedness properties.

#+BEGIN_SRC C
  int sort3(int x0, int x1, int x2){
      ...
      /* invariants (postconds)
      1. y0 - y1 <= 0
      2. y1 - y2 <= 0
      3. x0 + x1 + x2 - y0 - y1 - y2 == 0
      4. x1^2 + x1*x2 + x2^2 - x1*y0 - x2*y0 - x1*y1 - x2*y1 + y0*y1 - x1*y2 - x2*y2 + y0*y2 + y1*y2 == 0
      5. x2^3 - x2^2*y0 - x2^2*y1 + x2*y0*y1 - x2^2*y2 + x2*y0*y2 + x2*y1*y2 - y0*y1*y2 == 0
      6. min(x0, x1, x2) - y0 == 0
      7. y2 - max(x0, x1, x2) == 0
      */
      return (y1, y2, y3);
  }
#+END_SRC

The above program =sort3= sorts 3 numbers =x0, x1, x2= as =y0, y1, y2=.
DIG obtained the 7 invariants shown in the program. We show that these
invariants establish the correctness of this function, i.e., the outputs
are sorted and a permutation of the inputs.

1. The inequalities =1= and =2= shows that the output are sorted in
   ascending order, i.e., =y0 <= y1 <= y2=.

2. The next three equalities =4=, =5=, and =6= (especially =5= and =6=)
   are more complex and unexpected, but essentially together they
   indicate that the three outputs represent all possible permutations
   over the three inputs.

   1. First, by factoring eqt =6=, we get

   #+BEGIN_SRC C
     x2^3 - x2^2*y0 - x2^2*y1 + x2*y0*y1 - x2^2*y2 + x2*y0*y2 + x2*y1*y2 - y0*y1*y2 == 0 
     <=> (x2 - y0) (x2 - y1) (x2 - y2) == 0
   #+END_SRC

   This shows that =x2= can be =y0=, =y1=, or =y2=, i.e., =x2 == y0= ,
   =x2 == y1=, =x2 == y2=. Then for each of the cases, we combine with
   equality =5= and then factor it to obtain values for =x1=. For
   example, for =x2=y0=, we get

   #+BEGIN_SRC C
     (x2 == y0) and (x1^2 + x1x2 + x2^2 - x1y0 - x2y0 - x1y1 - x2y1 + y0y1 - x1y2 - x2y2 + y0y2 + y1y2 == 0)
     <=> (x1^2 - x1y1  - x1y2 + y1y2 == 0) <=> (x1 - y1) (x1 - y2) == 0
   #+END_SRC

   This shows that =x1 == y1= or =x1 == y2= when =x2 == y0=. We now can
   combine each case with equality =3= to obtain =x0=. For example, for
   =x1 == y2=, we get

   #+BEGIN_SRC C
     x2 == y0 and x1 == y2 and x0 + x1 + x2 - y0 - y1 - y2 == 0 
     <=> x0 - y1 == 0 
   #+END_SRC

   This shows that =x0 == y1= when =x1 == y2= and =x2 == y0=. Moreover,
   this result, =x0 == y1=, =x1 == y2]=, =x2 == y0=, is a permutation of
   the three inputs.

   If we expand all cases as shown, we will obtain all 6 permutations of
   =x1,x2,x3=.

3. Invariants =6= and =7= shows that =y0= and =y2= are the smallest and
   largest inputs, respectively. Technically, these are redundant
   because we can deduce them from the other invariants (which capture
   sortedness and permutations). But DIG still returns =6= and =7=
   because it might not be straightforward to understand the other
   invariants and realize that together they imply =6= and =7=.

Consider the program =sqrt= below, which computes the square root of an
integer using only addition. Our goal is to infer the loop invariants at
location =l= in the program.

#+BEGIN_SRC C
  int sqrt(int x){
    assert(x>=0); //precondition

    int a=0,s=1,t=1;
    while{
      // l: dynamically inferred invariants
      /*
      t =  2a + 1
      4s = t^2 + 2t + 1
      s = (a + 1)^2
      s >= t
      x <=  9989
      */
      if (!(s <= x)) break;
      a += 1;
      t += 2;
      s += t;
    }
    return a;
  }
#+END_SRC

The invariants given in the comments are /candidate/ invariants inferred
using dynamic analysis over some program execution traces, which are
obtained by running the program on some finite inputs. To determine if
these candiate invariants are valid, we need to formally prove them:
ones that are proved are kept and those that are disproved are removed.

*** TODO Inductive Loop invariants
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: inductive-loop-invariants
    :END:

A loop invariant is a property that is hold whenever the progarm enters
the loop, e.g., any property that holds at location =l= is the loop
invariant of the =while= loop in the =sqrt= program above. One popular
way to show if a property =I= is a loop invariant is using /standard
induction/ technique, which consists of two parts 1. we shows that =I=
holds the first time the loop is entered 2. we assume that =I= holds
when the loop is entered and shows that =I= is preserved after the loop
body is executed.

Loop invariants that are showed using such an induction technique are
called *inductive loop invariants*. Note that if this induction
technique fails (e.g., either 1 or 2 or both fail), then that just means
standard induction cannot prove the property. It does not mean that the
property is not a loop invariant as there are invariants that /cannot/
be proved using induction (more on this later).

*Example*: For the program =sqrt=, we prove that =t == 2a + 1= and
=4s == t^2 + 2t + 1= are inductive loop invariants:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  # t == 2a + 1:
  1. (x >= 0 && a == 0 && s == 1 && t == 1)  => t == 2a + 1  # checked
  2.  (t == 2a + 1 && s <= x && a' == a + 1 && t' == t + 2 && s' == s + t')  
      => t' == 2a + 1 + 2 =>  t' == 2(a' - 1) + 3 
      => t' == 2a' + 1   #checked

  # 4s == t^2 + 2t + 1  # checked
  1. (x >= 0 && a == 0 && s == 1 && t == 1)  => 4s == t^2 + 2t + 1
  2. (4s == t^2 + 2t + 1 && s <= x && a' == a + 1 && t' == t + 2 && s' == s + t') 
    => 4(s' - t') == (t' - 2)^2 + 2(t' - 2) + 1 
    => 4s' == t'^2 + 2t' + 1  #checked
#+END_EXAMPLE

However, we cannot use standard induction to show the other properties
=s == (a + 1)^2= and =s >= t=.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  # s == (a + 1)^2:
  1. (x >= 0 && a == 0 && s == 1 && t == 1)  => s == (a + 1)^2  # this is ok
  2.  (s == (a + 1)^2 + 1 && s <= x && a' == a + 1 && t' == t + 2 && s' == s + t')  
      => 
      => t' == 2a' + 1

  # 4s == t^2 + 2t + 1
  1. (x >= 0 && a == 0 && s == 1 && t == 1)  => 4s == t^2 + 2t + 1
  2. (4s == t^2 + 2t + 1 && s <= x && a' == a + 1 && t' == t + 2 && s' == s + t') 
    => 4(s' - t') == (t' - 2)^2 + 2(t' - 2) + 1 
    => 4s' == t'^2 + 2t' + 1
#+END_EXAMPLE

KIP successfully distinguishes true and false invariants from these
results. Specifically, we prove are inductive invariants and
$s == (a+1)^2$ is a $1$-inductive invariant (i.e., cannot be proved
using standard induction). By using proved results as lemmas, KIP is
able to show the invariant $s \ge t$, which is not $k$-inductive for
$k \le \mathsf{maxK}$, where $\mathsf{maxK}=5$ is the default setting of
KIP. The prover also rejects spurious relations such as $x\le 9989$ by
producing counterexamples that invalidate those relations in \lt{sqrt}.
The parallel implementation allows the prover to check these candidate
results simultaneously.

A program execution can be modeled as a state transition system
$M=(I,T)$ with $I$ representing the initial state of $M$, and $T$
specifying the transition relation of $M$ from a state $n-1$ to a state
$n$. To prove that $p$ is a \emph{state invariant} that holds at every
state of $M$, $k$-induction requires that $p$ hold for the first $k+1$
states (base case) and that $p$ hold for the state $n+k+1$ assuming that
it holds for the $k+1$ previous states (induction step). Formally,
$k$-induction proves the state invariant $p$ of $M=(I,T)$ by checking
the base case and induction step formulas:

\footnotesize
\begin{align}
  I \wedge T_1 \wedge \dots \wedge T_k \;&\Rightarrow \; p_0 \wedge \dots \wedge p_k\label{kind-1}\\
  p_n \wedge T_{n+1} \wedge  \dots \wedge p_{n+k} \wedge T_{n+k+1} \;&\Rightarrow \; p_{n+k+1}\label{kind-2}
\end{align} \normalsize

\noindent If both formulas hold then $p$ is a $k$-inductive invariant.
If the base case~\eqref{kind-1} fails then $p$ is disproved and thus is
not an invariant (assuming that $M$ correctly models the program).
However, if the base case holds but the induction step~\eqref{kind-2}
fails, then $p$ is not a $k$-inductive invariant, but it could still be
a program invariant. Thus, $k$-induction is a sound but incomplete proof
technique.

By considering multiple consecutive transitions, $k$-induction can prove
invariants that cannot be proved by standard induction ($0$-induction in
this formulation). For instance, the invariant $x\ne y$ of the machine
$M(I: (x=0 \wedge y=1 \wedge z=2)_0$,
$T_n: x_n == y_{n-1} \wedge y_n == z_{n-1} \wedge z_n = x_{n-1}$) that
rotates the values $0,1,2$ through the variables $x,y,z$ is not provable
by standard induction but is $k$-inductive with $k \ge 3$.\\
The notation $(P)_i$ denotes the formula $P$ with all free variables
subscripted by $i$, e.g., $(x + y == 1)_0$ is $x_0 + y_0 == 1$.
