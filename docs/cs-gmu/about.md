# Things to keep in mind
> No place is perfect, here are some of the complaints you may hear about the area

- Living cost of NOVA: 43.33% higher than the national average! 
  - Median household is ~105K (US Census'22)
    - National median is ~69K
  - Fairfax median household is $125K, making it ~55% higher than national average !!!
    - likely many of your neighbors will make more than you!

- Housing
  - Median home value in Fairfax is $646K (comparing to the national median of $310K, Zillow'22)

- Traffic:  DC area (which includes NOVA) consistently ranked among the most congest cities in the US

- **But all of these are nowhere compared to other big cities including the Bay Area, New York, Boston, Seattle**
