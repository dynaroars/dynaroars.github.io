<p>
I've finally got the NSF CAREER Award in my third and final try and so want to write a bit about my experience.
</p>

<p>
Timeline
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Summer'22: Third CAREER proposal attempt on DNN Verification (FM panel, recommended in Dec'22)</li>
<li>Summer'20: Second CAREER proposal attempt on Configurable Systems (SE panel, declined in Jan'21)</li>
<li>Summer'18: First CAREER proposal attempt on Inv Generation (PL panel, declined in Jan'19)</li>
<li>F'16: Start assistant prof.</li>
</ul>



<p>
My most recent and last attempt was on verifying deep neural networks (DNNs). It is a completely new topic to me, and in fact, I have no publications on this topic.  Yet, I believe the proposal was quite strong and evidently sufficiently strong to convince the reviewers (of course with a bit of luch and the fact that this was my last try).
</p>


<p>
My first CAREER proposal was on the dynamic inference of program invariants in Separation Logic.  Dynamic invariant inference is my Ph.D. dissertation and my main work, and the goal of the proposal was to extend it to find new types of invariants in Separation Logic to reason about program with heaps.

<li>I am very familiar with the invariant generation topic.</li>

<li>The topic is not very interesting.</li>
