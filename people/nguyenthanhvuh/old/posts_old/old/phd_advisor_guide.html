<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
Does the professor have tenure yet? [engagement level, PhD might get interrupted]
A: No, not yet. I am applying for tenure this semester in Spring'23.
</p>

<p>
It is worth noting that when I moved from UNL to GMU in 2021, all but 1 of my students who was graduating the next semester came with me.
</p></li>

<li>What is the professor’s formal training / background / PhD? [helps contextualize problems/approaches]
A: I did my Ph.D. in CS in the University of New Mexico-Albuquerque.  I started wanting to work on evolutionary computing, and then gradually changed to software engineering and programming languages.</li>

<li>What have previous lab members done after getting their PhD? [Gone to industry?/Post-doc?/Professor?]</li>

<li>What is the lab structure? [how collaborative/disjointed are lab members' projects?]</li>
</ol>


<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Does the advisor consider themselves a ‘hands-on’ or ‘hands-off’ advisor?</li>
<li>How does the advisor give feedback on papers/what is their feedback style?</li>
<li>How often does the advisor meet with their students? [1:1 or all together? Daily guidance by PI or post-doc?]</li>
<li>Are there lab meetings? What are other meetings you will see your advisor in a group with other people?</li>
<li>What does a group/lab meeting look like? [Or other relevant meetings]</li>
<li>How many students are in the group? [Number of undergrad/masters/phd/post doc]</li>
<li>What progress does the advisor generally expect from a student in the course of a semester? [Submission/Publication pace]</li>
<li>What other expectations does the advisor have for their students: time/vacation/paper/project/experiment wise etc.</li>
</ol>

◻
“When have you given a letter of concern? Why?”
◻
“What do you do when students are struggling”?
</p>

<p>
Research Fit &amp; Projects
</p>

<p>
How directly applicable will your future technical skills be to the roles you want after graduating. (If set on industry)
</p>

<p>
A: Most of the future technical skills in computer vision and machine learning will apply to many (either research or engineering) roles in the industry.
</p>

<p>
What’ research methods’ does the lab use? (What ‘types’ of papers / contributions / conferences targeted)
</p>

<p>
A: Our work is often empirically driven and focuses on developing robust algorithms that work under unconstrained environments (e.g., everyday photos/videos). Target conferences are Vision CVPR/ICCV/ECCV; Graphics: SIGGRAPH/SIGGRAPH Asia; Learning: ICLR/NeurIPS. For work we wish to extend, we also publish in journals such as IEEE T-PAMI / IJCV.
</p>

<p>
“What are some of the projects that you and your students are currently working on”?
</p>

<p>
A: We are working on various computational photography projects, including view synthesis, 3D photos/videos, and generative models for controllable image/video synthesis. We are also interested in tackling challenging problems with positive societal impacts.
</p>

<p>
“In general, do you tend to give your students projects or have them select their own”?
</p>

<p>
A: It depends. I prefer students to develop and pursue their ideas. My research agenda is my students’ agenda. However, this could be challenging for junior students. For junior students, I constrain the project scope a bit so they can focus on developing their core research skills.
</p>

<p>
“Do you have particular projects that you see me working on”?
</p>

<p>
A: It depends on your background and interests.
</p>

<p>
“How much freedom do you think I'd have in selecting my own projects”?
</p>

<p>
A: We need to brainstorm to find projects or research directions that we are both passionate about. For example, if you select a project that is entirely outside my expertise, I will need more support to provide the support you need. If that's the case, we can discuss several options, such as switching to a different advisor or finding another faculty with the relevant expertise to co-advise your projects.
</p>

<p>
“Are there other students you are interested in working with? If so, what would they be working on project-wise”?
</p>

<p>
A: I will be able to answer this after reviewing the pool of applicants.
</p>

<p>
“Would they have their own line of work or contribute to a bigger project/someone else's project”?
</p>

<p>
A: It's up to you. Leading a project yourself is the best way to get you started for learning how to do research. Usually a, student has their line of work and 1-2 projects where they collaborate with/support others.
</p>


<p>
Student-Advisor Fit / Placement
</p>

<p>
[If you are interested] Would the advisor be interested in co-advising?
</p>

<p>
A: Of course! If co-advising helps your research, why not? Let me know if you find another faculty within UMD with the expertise that can help with your work. Even faculty/researchers outside UMD would work as well. We can reach out and see if there are opportunities for collaboration.
</p>

<p>
“Are you taking a student” /“Do you have funding to take students in this year (or, for which projects)”
</p>

<p>
A: We always are looking for new students each year. Our lab is growing. I plan to recruit 2-4 Ph.D. students starting in Fall 2023.
</p>

<p>
“What factors will affect whether or not you take a student”?
</p>

<p>
A: Research interests, background, and motivation.
</p>

<p>
“How do you anticipate your funding to change during my time as a student”?
</p>

<p>
A: I do not anticipate any changes. Your time as a student will be fully funded either by a research or a teaching assistantship.
</p>

<p>
“Do you think our research interests are a good match”?
</p>

<p>
A: Let me know what you like to work on.
</p>

<p>
“Are there other students in my cohort that you're interested in working with”? (If so, are you taking more than one student?)
</p>

<p>
A: Not yet. I plan to recruit 2-4 Ph.D. students this year.
</p>

<p>
“I'm interested in working with you. Do you think I'd have a good chance of working with you if I come to your university”?
</p>

<p>
A: I would be more than happy to chat! If you come, we can work on a small-scale project and see if this is what you are looking for. In the meantime, feel free to reach out to other faculty and explore different opportunities.
</p>

<p>
“Are there other faculty you think I'd be a good match for”?
</p>

<p>
A: Yes! Check out the list of faculty members grouped by area. Here are a couple of areas that overlap with mine.
</p>

<p>
Computer Vision and Machine Perception,
</p>

<p>
Machine Learning and Data Science,
</p>

<p>
Graphics Visualization and VR AR,
</p>

<p>
AI and Robotics,
</p>

<p>
Natural Language Processing.
