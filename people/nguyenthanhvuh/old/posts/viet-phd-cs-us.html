<p>
Having been involved in Ph.D. admissions for many years and having
numerous discussions with international (especially Vietnamese) students
interested in Ph.D. programs in Computer Science in the US, I've
realized that many international students lack a clear understanding of
the admission process at US universities. This confusion not only
discourages students from applying but also creates the perception that
getting accepted is difficult compared to Ph.D. programs in other
universities.
</p>

<p>
So I want to share my personal opinions and recommendations for
international students who are interested in applying for a Ph.D. in
Computer Science in the US. While I wrote this with Vietnamese
applicants in mind, my observation and advice should be applicable to
general international students.
</p>

<p>
If you have suggestions or comments, feel free to create a
<a href="https://github.com/dynaroars/dynaroars.github.io/issues">Github issue</a> for discussion.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-funding-and-should-you-apply" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="funding-and-should-you-apply"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Funding and Should you apply?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-funding-and-should-you-apply">
<p>
First and foremost, I want to emphasize that Ph.D. students in Computer
Science <i>do not</i> need to worry about funding, especially at R1
universities in the US. If you are admitted, you will almost certainly
receive <i>full funding</i> to support your studies, including tuition,
health insurance, and a monthly stipend. Depending on the university,
you may even receive additional benefits like summer salary. Note that
this funding is typically available for Ph.D. students and not for
Master's students.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
at GMU, in addition to the usual tuition waiving and health insurance,
admitted students are guaranteed with a GTA stipend (graduate teaching
assistantship) which is $28K/9-month for 4 years and a 3-month summer
salary ($9K, so $37K first year).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Second, I believe that applying to a good US university is not any
harder than at good schools in other countries. If you think you have a
chance at schools in other countries, then you surely have a chance in
the US as well.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
One of the reasons I create this post is that several CS faculty has
asked me to help recruit Vietnamese students. In general the number of
CS Ph.D applications to universities in the US is very low (compared to
other countries such as India and China) and I personally would like to
see more applications from Vietnam.
</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-application" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="application"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Application</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-application">
<p>
<b>How is your application evaluated?</b> After you submit your
Ph.D. application (usually in mid-December), it will be first screened
for general requirements (e.g., did you submit things that are required,
did you pay application fee etc). And then it will be reviewed by a
Ph.D. admission committee consisting of faculty members in the
department. Each application is typically reviewed by about three
faculty members who assess various aspects, such as transcripts and
letters of recommendation, to reach a consensus about your case.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
At GMU, we usually decide that a candidate is either (i) accepted with
funding (GTA or GRA) or (ii) rejected. In other words, either we either
accept you with full funding, or we don't. In some rare cases, we accept
you with no funding because you have funding on your own (e.g., you are
supported by your government or have external grants). Also, we justify
our decision with a short summary about your application and in it list
strengths (e.g., well-known undergrad school) and weaknesses (e.g., weak
LoRs).
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
It is worth noting that most Ph.D. committee members are <i>new assistant
professors</i>. This is designed to give junior faculty, who don't have
students yet, the opportunities to recruit students. The chair of the
committee will be a tenured/senior faculty, but they typically will not
review your papers and instead assign it to other committee members. So,
keep that in mind.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The primary focus of the admissions committee is to <i>evaluate your
background and interest in research</i> since a Ph.D. in Computer Science
is a research degree. To assess your research capability, they consider
several key indicators:
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-research-ability." class="outline-3">
<h3 id="research-ability."><span class="section-number-3">2.1.</span> Research ability.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-research-ability.">
<p>
The most effective evidence of research ability is having published
papers in reputable international conferences and journals. It's
important to aim for the top conferences in your field, which you can
find on places such as CSRankings, designed specifically to help PhD
applicants. Local conferences and non-English journals or conferences do
not carry as much weight since their quality is often unknown to US
faculty. However, I understand that most Vietnamese students (even
professors) do not have the opportunities to publish in top places, so
general IEEE/ACM/USENIX confs/journals would suffice.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, work or internship experiences at renowned research
laboratories, such as Microsoft Research, can significantly enhance your
application. However, working at local companies or research places that
are not widely known might not have the same impact. Top research places
in Vietnam, e.g., VinAI, unfortunately are still relatively unknown to
most universities in the US. It's getting more well-known though, but do
not assume US faculty know about them, i.e., you should explicit say
something about them in your statement.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, if you have participated in top international programming
competitions, it can also demonstrate your research potential,
especially if you want to do research in topics that "build" stuff,
e.g., my area in software engineering, formal methods.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-letters-of-recommendation-lors." class="outline-3">
<h3 id="letters-of-recommendation-lors."><span class="section-number-3">2.2.</span> Letters of recommendation (LoRs).</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-letters-of-recommendation-lors.">
<p>
Having a letter from an internationally recognized researcher can
greatly strengthen your application. However, obtaining such a letter
can be challenging. It's acceptable to have a letter from any professor
who knows you well enough to talk about <i>your specific</i> research
experience and capabilities. Note that generic letters or letters
written by the applicant themselves have little value. - Many students
write their own letters and have professors sign them. These have little
values (we can easily recognize them) and can be considered as
weaknesses. - Similarly, many professors write very generic letters
about the students (a common example is that the students didn't do any
research or make any impression for the professor to write about). These
letters are also not useful and considered weak. - Many students get
letters from someone from company where they did internship or are
working at. It is OK as long as it is a research-based personalized
letter. Though it is very rare to get such letters from companies (e.g.,
your supervisor is unlikely a researcher or have the background to
assess your research ability).
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
PhD Admission committee takes LoRs very seriously and we read them
carefully. For me personally, it's better to have a good personalized
letter about your own research ability from someone who is less
well-known than a generic/weak letter from a well-known person.
</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-your-research-personal-statement." class="outline-3">
<h3 id="your-research-personal-statement."><span class="section-number-3">2.3.</span> Your research (personal) statement.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-your-research-personal-statement.">
<p>
While you might not be able to get good LoRs or change
<a href="#your-school">where your go to school</a>, you have control of your
statement! And you know we will read it, so write it well. Another
reason for having a well-written LOR is that it allows us to evaluate
how you communicate, which is very important in research. Moreover, it
is important because if you need (GTA) funding, it will provide evidence
that you can teach and communicate with students.
</p>

<p>
There are many guides on writing research statement (e.g., this
<a href="https://chrisblattman.com/blog/2022/01/11/phd-applicants-writing-your-statement-of-purpose/">one</a>),
so I will not talk too much about it. In short, convince us that you can
do research through your previous/current experience, e.g., if you work
on some projects, talk about it.
</p>

<p>
Finally, this is something that very easy to do, but is missed by many
applicants: <i>customize the statement</i> for the school you're applying to,
e.g., why do you apply there ? name some professors who you're
interested in working with (this might help your letter get sent to
them). Be careful not to send wrong statement to wrong school or mixing
facts (e.g., talking about school X but mentioned wanting to work with
profs. at school Y). I have seen such statements more time that I
should.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
For me I always read the research statement first and then LoRs. If I am
persuaded by then, I would skim over other factors and advocate for
acceptance (unless I see something so bad in other parts). If I am not
convinced, then I will likely recommend rejection (unless I see
something standout in other parts).
</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-your-school" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="your-school"><span class="section-number-3">2.4.</span> Your school</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-your-school">
<p>
Attending top universities help a lot. However, most universities in
Vietnam, even the top ones, are unknown to outsiders. Part of the reason
is that Vietnamese universities aren't really active in the
international research community, e.g., faculty do not publish in the
top venues. So US faculty likely will not know much about the top
schools in Vietnam or many other countries and just treat your school as
"unknown foreign" (if your school is well-known, then it is "top
foreign").
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I've created a document containing the top schools in several countries
and share it with other PhD admission committees.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-gradesgres." class="outline-3">
<h3 id="gradesgres."><span class="section-number-3">2.5.</span> Grades/GREs.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-gradesgres.">
<p>
Having good grades in related courses is important, but of course not as
important as other things such as LOR and statements above. However, in
general, unless your school is well-known, having top grades/ranks
usually will not help. This is simply because we cannot evaluate them.
This is actually a big issue for students in top universities in Vietnam
where the competition is so high that even students that ranked low are
still very good. So what to do with this? well, apply to a place with a
Vietnamse faculty! Otherwise you should put a note about this in your
statement.
</p>

<p>
Not that while having good grades at unknown school does not help,
having bad grades will generally hurt your case (unless your LoRs or
statements give proper explaination). This is especially true if you
have bad grades in CS/Math/Engineering courses.
</p>

<p>
Most CS programs in the US no longer require GREs, so you don't need to
take them unless you think it will help prove something. You do need to
take some standarized English test. Just do well enough to pass minimum
requirement set by the university.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I typically just scan over your transcripts looking for "bad" grades in
related courses. If you have very good grades from top schools that I
know, I will also put a note on it.

<li>Asking professors if they can get in or if they take students.<br>
&gt; Many international students will write professors asking if they can
get in, or if they are taking students. Unlikely anyone will reply to
such email because the short answer is we simply cannot evaluate your
profile ourselves, it needs to go to the whole committee as explained.
Even if a professor is seeking for students (almost everyone is
looking for good students), they simply cannot take one in without
going through the application process.</li>

<li>How long for a CS Ph.D. in US ? &gt; 5-6 years on avg.</li>

<li>Does having an MS help? &gt; It can help if the MS gives research
experience or is from a more well-known school than your
undergraduate. But not having an MS does not hurt either. Nowadays it
is normal for students with bachelor degrees apply directly to
Ph.D. in CS.</li>

<p>
That's it. Wish you the best of luck. And if you follow these advice,
you will at least have a good chance at GMU (see

<p>
The goal of this post is to help answer questions about CS Ph.D. funding the U.S. The summary is that, <b>if you get admitted to a Ph.D. program in the US (and probably also at many other countries), you do not need to worry about tuition, insurance, and living expense</b>.   This is unlike undergraduate or even Master programs, in which the students typically <b>do</b> have to take care of tuition, insurance, and other living expense.
As a concrete example, at George Mason, CS Ph.D. student receive $28,000 for 9-month and about $9,000 for the summer in their first year (so about $37,000 <b>stipend</b> in total), and of course they do not have to pay for tuition or insurance.  In fact, many GMU Ph.D. students in CS have family and this stipend is sufficient to support their family.
