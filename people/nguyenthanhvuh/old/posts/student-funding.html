The goal of this post is to help answer questions about CS Ph.D. funding the U.S. The summary is that, <b>if you get admitted to a Ph.D. program in the US (and probably also at many other countries), you do not need to worry about tuition, insurance, and living expense</b>.   This is unlike undergraduate or even Master programs, in which the students typically <b>do</b> have to take care of tuition, insurance, and other living expense.
As a concrete example, at George Mason, CS Ph.D. student receive $28,000 for 9-month and about $9,000 for the summer in their first year (so about $37,000 <b>stipend</b> in total), and of course they do not have to pay for tuition or insurance.  In fact, many GMU Ph.D. students in CS have family and this stipend is sufficient to support their family.

<div id="outline-container-org1c32c73" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org1c32c73"><span class="section-number-3">1.2.</span> Research Assistanship at School</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The most common type is <b>graduate assistanship</b>, which is either graduate teaching assistant (GTA or TA) or graduate research assistant (GRA or RA).</li>
<li>Both come with tuition waiver, insurance, and stipend</li>
<li>Stipend is your salary  
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The amount of stipend depends on the university, which in turns depend on location (e.g., a stipend in Washington DC is likely higher than in Lincoln, Nebraska due to higher living cost)</li>
<li>Because a school year is (typically) 9-month in the US, so stipend is for 9 months (so divide by 9 for each month)</li>
<li>You have to pay tax on your stipend</li>
<li>Private universities might pay more for stipend</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Some universities also pay insurance for spouse (or give very good discount)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc0f64cc" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgc0f64cc"><span class="section-number-4">1.2.1.</span> GTA</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-2-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>is paid through the department</li>
<li>helps with teaching class (typically grading)</li>
<li>works with various courses and professors (not necessary their advisor)</li>
<li>Typically no summer because no school</li>
<li><b>Advice</b>: GTA is common in the beginning, when you haven't found your advisor.  But even if you get GRA, you should do GTA at least a semester or two, just to see how teaching is like.</li>
</ul>

<pre class="example" id="org44661a7">
Example: At GMU, when a student is admitted as a GRA, the benefits they received are tution waiver, insurance, a 9-month stipend of $28K + a summer stipend of $9K (for the 1st summer only).  GTA is guaranteed for 4 years.

<h4 id="orge3fddb7"><span class="section-number-4">1.2.2.</span> GRA</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-2-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>is paid through a professor (typically your advisor)</li>
<li>works with a professor on a research project</li>
<li>Summer is possible, depending on the prof.</li>
<li><b>Advice</b>: This is the <b>most</b> common type of funding!  It is also ideal because you don't have to teach and so can focus on your research.</li>

<div id="outline-container-org93928dd" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org93928dd"><span class="section-number-3">1.3.</span> Fellowship</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Another kind of funding is <b>fellowship</b>, in which the student applies from an external source (e.g., industries, government).</li>
<li>Fellowships are typically very competitive and generous, which covers pretty much everything that the research assistant ship at school covers, and gives even higher stipend (including summer).
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Typically 3-5 years</li>
<li>Examples of such fellowships include the NSF Graduate Fellowship (needs to be a permanent resident or citizen) or Google Fellowship</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Advice</b>: Fellowship is very competitive, but that's why you will stand out if you get one.  Not only you save your advisor lots of money yearly, it looks really good on your resume.  Every Ph.D. in CS has pubs, but typically only superstars have NSF grad or Meta fellowship (in fact, these are so prestigious that even if you didn't get it but make it to the final round, you still should put it on your CV).</li>

<h3 id="org5cf091c"><span class="section-number-3">1.4.</span> Self-funded</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Some Ph.D. students are funded through their company
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The students work full time for the company and do their Ph.D. part-time</li>
<li>Typically will take longer (because you have to work full time) and require some serious committement from the students</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Some Ph.D. students are funded through country, e.g., GMU has several students from Saudi Arabia that are funded through their government.</li>

<h2 id="org97f8ad1"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> How does GRA work?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
While you might get a 9-month $28K GRA stipend,  your advisor typically has to budget at least twice that much.  Because they have to pay your tuitition, insurance, and overhead that the university takes.  The chart below shows that each CS GRA costs about $70K at GMU.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Example budget of a Ph.D. student in CS at GMU.  Using stipend and tuition rate in 2023. Conference Registration and Travel are estimates.</li>
<li>It is also <b><b>very likely</b></b> that GMU faculty won't have to pay student tuition starting Fall 2025, when this happens then we can take out  Tuition and total cost is 46.5K.</li>
