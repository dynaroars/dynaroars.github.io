<li>Using CSRankings, GMU is the highest ranked university in Virgnia and ranked 33th national wide in Computer Science.</li>
<li>Compared to some other schools that are more well-known, it is tied with Harvard (also 33), and higher than Brown (35), Texas A&amp;M (37), Yale (37), UVA (46), and VTech (48).</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>About 80 faculty, 40 new hires in the past 3 years</li>
<li>Just 3 years ago it was outside of the top 50 in CSRankings, and within these pandemic years CS@GMU made great effort to recruit strong CS faculty (in contrast most other schools slow down their hiring during the pandemic).
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>At this rate, it is expected that GMU will be top 30 in the next few months and perhaps top 20 in a year or so.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This growth has been noticed by many others, especially faculty in CS, and that greatly attracts top faculty candidates and Ph.D. candidates to GMU.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Spring 2023, over 400 applications for 5 tenured-track positions</li>
<li>Getting top Ph.D. students we want over more well-known school such as Penn State.</li>

<li>Industrial collaboration is common among the faculty (given that Amazon and all the large companies have presence in DC), and many faculty have industrial researd awards).</li>

<li>Publishing at top venues are important to the research career of students, and my students get to publish at top-tier SE/PL conferences
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>e.g., Didier at <b>OOPSLA</b>, Guolong at <b>PLDI</b>, KimHao, <i>an undergrad</i>, at <b>ICSE</b> and <b>TSE</b>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Moreover, my students are productive
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>e.g., when they graduate, Guolong has 8 papers, KimHao has 7 papers</li>
</ul></li>
<li>CS is all about collaboration and networking, and  my students get to collaborate and work with top researchers in academia or industry
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>e.g., Hai is working with Matt Dywer at UVA; KimHao works with Quoc-Sang at Meta</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Normal TA/RA is for the 9-month academic year, but I aim to support my students the full 12 months (unless they have summer internships, which I really encourage)</li>

GMU is an R1 university in Fairfax, Virginia.  It is the youngest university in VA (<a href="https://50th.gmu.edu/">50 years</a>), but is already the largest in VA (about 38,000 students). The university is strategically located in the Northern VA and Washington DC area. It is close to NSF, DARPA, ONR, NASA, and many other (funding) agencies, and large tech companies including Amazon 2nd HQ (and soon Boeing HQ). Fairfax is one of the most diversed and richest (also most expensive) place in the US.
