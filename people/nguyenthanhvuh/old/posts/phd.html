<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A Ph.D. is a <b>long-term</b> <b>research</b> exploration of a <b>single</b> topic.</li>
<li>Typically around <b>six years</b></li>
<li>The focus of a Ph.D. is on <b>depth</b> rather than breadth.</li>
<li>The goal of a Ph.D. is to produce a world <b>expert</b> in a specific research area.</li>
<li><p>
This <a href="https://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/">series of pictures</a> from <a href="https://matt.might.net">Matt Might</a> illustrates what a Ph.D. means
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
TVN: I spent <i>seven</i> years (2007 - 2014, with an 8-month internship) on my Ph.D. In the first couple of years I explored various topics including security and genetic algorithms. From my 3rd year on I work on software engineering and programming analysis, focusing on automatic programming and invariant generation.
</p>

<p>
So far I have graduated 1 student, Guolong, who finished in 5 years.

<h3 id="org642101d"><span class="section-number-3">1.4.</span> Funding during the Ph.D.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Typically you <b>do not</b> need to worry about funding for the Ph.D. degree in CS.</li>
<li>Most popular types of funding include graduate assistentships, which including teaching assistant or research assistant, and fellowship or scholarship.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Your <b>graduate assistantship</b> will fully pay your <b>tuition</b>, <b>health insurance</b>, and also give you a <b>living stipend</b></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>




<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You will typically receive a living stipend of around $2000 per month, which you will use to pay for your living expenses.</li>
<li>The Ph.D. is a tremendous opportunity, where you get to do research in any area you like, receive mentoring, think deeply on problems, publish papers, and become well-known, all while paying zero tuition for 6 years and receiving a salary.</li>
<li>Your advisor is paying for this opportunity by writing grant proposals to companies and the government to ask for funding.</li>
<li>At most schools, you can only do a Research Assistantship (RAship) if you have an advisor who has funding for you. Alternatively, you may have to work as a Teaching Assistant (TA) every semester to get your stipend.</li>
<li>There are many companies and government organizations which offer Graduate Fellowships for Ph.D. students. If you are lucky enough to get one of these, they will cover most of your way through graduate school, and you will never have to worry about whether your advisor has funding or not. Details about graduate fellowships will be discussed in Section 4.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
TVN: During my Ph.D., I was funded mostly through RA from my advisor. I also got a NASA Spacegrant Graduate Research Fellowship for 2 years.
</p>

<p>
Currently, I was able to provide RA supports for all of my students. In the past when I don't have sufficient funding, my students get GTA supports from the dept.  I highly encourage my students to apply for external fellowships and awards (e.g., KimHao got a Garmin scholarship for 2 years).

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-5">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Upon completing a Ph.D., most students either go into academia or research labs, while some never do research again.</li>
<li>If you become a professor at a research university, your job consists of (1) doing research (publications); (2) obtain funding to support your students; (3) mentoring students to do research (mostly Ph.D. students but you can also include MS and undergraduate, and even highschool); (4) teaching classes;  (5) doing service (at both your university and in your professional community).</li>
<li>If you become a professor at a teaching college, your job mainly focuses on teaching classes, doing service, and advising undergraduates on undergraduate research.</li>
<li>If you go to a research lab, your job will consist of doing research on both company and personal projects, working with other people in the company, and occasionally traveling to give talks and work with others.</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-6">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A Ph.D. is not for everyone and requires a significant time commitment.</li>
<li>Before applying for a Ph.D., it's important to have tried research and/or teaching and found that you like at least one of those.</li>
<li>A Ph.D. requires a particular type of personality, including being obsessed with problem-solving, having tremendous perseverance, and being willing to do whatever it takes to solve a problem.</li>
<li>It's important to know why you want a Ph.D. and have vision and ideas that you can express.</li>
<li>If unsure, working in a research or industrial lab for a few years can help with decision-making. Don't apply to graduate school until sure about what you want.</li>

<p>
<b>My own story</b>: After I finished my B.A. in CS and Math, I went to work at the Advanced Machine Intelligence Lab at GTE in Massachusetts. At first I was very excited by my paycheck and the great feeling of being independent. I also really enjoyed my area of research at the time: pattern recognition and classification. I was working with frame-of-reference transformations in- volving eigenvectors of autocorrelation matrices. It was exciting! However I quickly realized that I wanted to know more. I wanted to know why some algorithms produced good results and others didn’t. I wanted to come up with my own algorithms. I worried that I didn’t have enough of a mathe- matics background to answer my own questions. In summary, I wanted to delve deeper. Everyone around me thought I was very odd for wanting these things. I left after 2 years and went to graduate school. That first month of graduate school I looked around and realized that everyone there was just as weird and obsessed as I was, and I knew I had made the right decision.

<h2 id="org4a6cf75"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> The Application Process</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Here are the key points to keep in mind about the Ph.D. application process:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Transcript, which includes grades and classes taken</li>
<li>TOEFL/IELTS/DuoLingo scores</li>
<li>Personal statement</li>
<li>Previous research experience, including industry experience</li>
<li>Recommendation letters</li>
<li>Awards and extracurricular activities</li>
</ul>
<p>
For top-ranked CS programs, the most important component is usually prior research experience and what your recommendation letters and personal statement say about it. Lower-ranked schools may rely more on formulas based on GPA, undergraduate school, and test scores to classify applications. The application process is highly competitive, and success depends on factors beyond just being smart, including determination and perseverance.
</p>
</div>



<div id="outline-container-org5cb31cb" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5cb31cb"><span class="section-number-3">2.1.</span> Transcript – grades and classes</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A rough guideline for grades in CS, Math, and Engineering classes is around 3.5 out of 4.0, but it's better to focus on research than on optimizing GPA.</li>
<li>Research experience is what matters the most when applying to top CS programs. A 4.0 GPA alone with no research experience won't get you into any top CS program.</li>
<li>GPAs are evaluated in the context of the undergraduate program, so a 3.4 GPA from a top-ranked CS undergraduate program counts the same as a 3.8 or 3.9 GPA from a less well-known CS undergraduate program.</li>
<li>Taking arbitrary extra classes usually doesn't lead to doing more research. One or two carefully selected graduate classes may help find interesting research problems to work on.</li>
<li>It's possible to do an MS to boost grades and reapply for a Ph.D. program.</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-org5b9b896" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5b9b896"><span class="section-number-3">2.2.</span> GRE scores and TOEFL</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The GRE exam has two parts: the general GRE exam and the subject exam (which no longer exists for CS).</li>
<li>The general GRE exam consists of Quantitative, Verbal, and Analytic Writing portions, and is 3 hours long.</li>
<li>The subject exam still exists for other areas like Math, and Math departments check this score.</li>
<li>Study guides for the GRE exam are available in bookstores and online.</li>
<li>The Verbal and Quantitative portions are similar to the SAT, but may be more challenging due to being out of practice or competing with people who majored in English.</li>
<li>The Analytic Writing portion consists of two essays, one where you analyze an argument and the other where you give your perspective on a topic.</li>
<li>The GRE exam is offered every 2 months and can be taken on the same day or different days.</li>
<li>Your score on the GRE exam may not matter much to top schools but can be important for lesser-ranked schools.</li>
<li>The TOEFL exam is required for non-native English speakers and is taken seriously by schools.</li>
<li>CMU pays the most attention to the Speaking TOEFL score, and a score of less than 22-23 can hurt your chances of admission.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org081d3fa" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org081d3fa"><span class="section-number-3">2.3.</span> Personal or Research statement</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Very important as admission commitees do look at this carefully</li>
<li>This statement is all show you have research potential (research that you have done, its results, your research goal, etc).  Afterall, PhD is all about research and this statement is to convince the readers that you have what it takes to do research.</li>
<li>Template for Research statement (borrowed from TODO)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>First paragraph: describe the general areas of research that interest you and why.</li>
<li>Second, third, and fourth paragraphs: describe some research projects you have worked on, including the problem you were trying to solve, why it was important, the approaches you tried, and what you learned.</li>
<li>Fifth paragraph: explain why you feel you need a Ph.D. and refer back to the previous section.</li>
<li>Sixth paragraph: explain why you want to come to the specific school and which professors you would like to work with.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Common mistake to avoid
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Talk about your grades and strong course works. Having good grades does not necessary mean you can do research!</li>
<li>Talk about your childhood and dream.  Again, these do not give evidence that you can do research.</li>
<li>Not customized your letter to the school you're applying for. Avoid writing a generic letter that can be sent to multiple schools.  You should customize last paragraph in the statement for the school you're applying to.</li>
<li>The last paragraph about the school states the wrong school or wrong professor. It is embarrasing that you're applying to a school X but your statement talks about school Y or professors that are not faculty at X.  Also, do not talk about George Washington when applying to George Mason !!!</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Prior research experience is necessary to get into top graduate schools, but it may not be necessary for schools below the top 10.</li>
<li>Research experience does not necessarily mean having published a paper or yielding results, but rather demonstrating knowledge of research.</li>
<li>There are five places to gain research experience:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Work with a professor as an undergraduate and receive course credit or payment during the summer.</li>
<li>Apply for summer internships at research labs or other schools, such as REUs.</li>
<li>Get a job after graduating that allows for research opportunities.</li>
<li>Work on an M.S. project during graduate school.</li>
<li>Work alone or with a friend by seeking out interesting open problems and new research.</li>
</ul></li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-5">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Make a list of professors you want to work with and read about their research.</li>
<li>Create a one-page summary sheet with your name, contact info, research interests, availability, classes taken, previous experience, and skills.</li>
<li>Talk to your undergraduate advisor to see if there are any open positions for undergraduate research.</li>
<li>Contact professors from your list and schedule an appointment to discuss your interest in research. Be prepared to answer questions about your math and programming background.</li>
<li>If a professor declines, try the next person on your list.</li>
<li>If a professor accepts, ask questions about the project's goals, your responsibilities, who you will work with, and background materials to read.</li>
<li>If rejected, try other ways to get involved, such as taking a grad class, helping a grad student, or attending seminars/group meetings.</li>
<li>For international applicants, publish in internationally recognized conferences and create a web site with links to your papers in English to help the admissions committee evaluate your research.</li>

<li>Letters of recommendation are an important part of your application for a Ph.D. program or fellowship.</li>
<li>You need 3 letters of recommendation for a Ph.D. program and typically 4 letters for a fellowship.</li>
<li>You want all your letters of recommendation to be strong.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Letters that say you did well in class (i.e., type 1) will not count.</li>
<li>You want letters that highlight your research potential and initiative (i.e., type 2).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ask for letters from people who have seen you do research, such as professors or employers.</li>
<li>It's better to ask for letters from people who are known to the admissions committee.</li>
<li>Professors' letters count the most, followed by research scientists, lecturers, systems scientists, employers, or postdocs.</li>
<li>Do not ask for a letter from a graduate student; ask the professor who supervises them instead.</li>
<li>If you've been working for a while, you'll need a letter from your employer and two letters from professors.</li>
<li>Keep in touch with professors during your time at work to have them write strong letters.</li>

Steps to maximize the contents of your recommendation letter:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Prepare a packet for each recommender containing:
a. Your statement of purpose
b. A summary of every research project you worked on
c. A list of all math/cs/engineering/science classes you have taken with the names of professors and grades
d. A list of extracurricular activities and awards/competitions</li>
<li>Include a recent photo of yourself at the top of the packet, along with directions on where to send the letter and confirmation information.</li>
<li>Ask your potential recommender if they feel comfortable writing a strong letter of recommendation for you to graduate school.</li>
<li>Check with the school to confirm they received a letter from each of your recommenders.</li>
<li>Remember to send your recommender a thank-you card or gift.</li>

<p>
I've been in the Ph.D. admission committee for the past 7 years and have read and discuss many applications. So I thought it might be useful to share my thoughts about how to write an good application. My aim is to help <b>international students</b>, in particular <b>Vietnamese students</b>, who might not be too familiar with the CS grad school admission process in the US. Of course, this goes without saying that these are just my personal opinion and experience and so they might or might not apply in your case.

<h3 id="org6000985"><span class="section-number-3">5.1.</span> Do I really have a chance to apply to a Ph.D. program in the US?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>short answer: <b>yes, you do</b>!</li>
<li>If you plan to apply Ph.D. programs at other countries (e.g., Singapore, Australia) then there is no reason to not try your chance at a U.S. universities.</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-orgdc095ae" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgdc095ae"><span class="section-number-3">5.2.</span> Why I get rejected? (why do Vietnamese applications often get rejected from US universities?)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Reason 1: US profs. do not know well about schools in Vietnam.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They treat Bach Khoa or other top Vietnamese university as just unknown/unfamiliar foreign universities.  This is not just Vietnamese schools, but schools in other countries too. There are just simply too many schools and we simply can't know all of them except may be the top 100 ones (and unfortunately Bach Khoa is not the top 100).</li>
<li><b>Solution</b>: It helps if you explicitly state your university is the top in your statement.  It also helps a lot if there is a Vietnamese in the faculty who can tell them the top universities in VN.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Reason 2: your writing is poor
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Understandably, Vietnamese students do not write good English.  You are also not used to the English writing style, e.g., too short, too verbose, too formal, too informal.  So if we can't understand your writing, don't feel exciting or convinced, then your application won't get far.</li>
<li><b>Solution</b>: get someone who has experiences with writing statement to help.</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>short answer: <b>If you seriously want to work with that professor, then yes, you should</b>.</li>
<li>To be effective, you need to do your homework about the work of that professor, shows them that you know about their work (e.g., read a couple of their papers, talk about it)</li>
<li>Also say why your experience and background make you a good candidate for those research.</li>

</ul>





<p>
## Statement
&gt; Your statement determines your research potential. It is perhaps the most important part of the application. Ph.D. admission committee reads it carefully. Make it as good as you can. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Pay attention to some of these details
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Double check for wrong university or professors' names.  It will not look good if you're applying to university `X`, and then at the end talk about how good university `Y` is or how you would like to work a professor at university `Y`.</li>
<li>Do not talk about your childhood dream, unless it is true and unique. And even if it is, we don't really care much unless it is very very unique somehow.  Focus on experience and accomplishment that show you can do research.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
## Recommendation or Reference Letters
&gt; This letter is very important.  It can signficantly hurt or help your application.  So pay very careful attention to these letters
</p>

<p>
It is likely that we do not know your school or your professor. 
</p>



<p>
## Grades and Test Scores
&gt; For a Ph.D. in CS , these are somewhat important because you have to meet certain minimum to be considered. Having a good GPA from a <b>well-known</b> school helps!  But other than that, other documents including ref letters and your statement are much more important.
