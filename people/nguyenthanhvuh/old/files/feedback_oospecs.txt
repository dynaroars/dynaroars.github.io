SWE619: OO Specs & Construction
-------------------------------

Spring 2024


I like the open internet nature of the class, professor and students regularly looked up answers to difficult
questions so that everyone has a clear understanding of all concepts.
I also liked using python/other language libraries for demonstration of concepts that we can use in the
industry.
2. Open Notes Quizzes, I really enjoy the freedom to refer to notes or look up concepts online. It helps focus on
the task instead of spending time remembering information that could easily be found somewhere.
3. Nothing that I can think of. I really enjoyed this class.

---

1. Favorite: having group work was helpful, Least favorite: Sometimes found material not
applicable to real-world scenarios
2. In-Class assignments are helpful for reviewing material
3. Having all course material (eg notes/in class assignments etc) in a single document would be helpful

---
What were your favorite things about the class? What were your least favorite things?
Ans:
Group assignments and interactive learning
2.
Favorite things the professor did or didn’t do?
Ans:
Professor was really friendly and extremely interactive
3. What would you change for next time?
No I don’t think so I loved the class.
Thank You !!

1. What were your favorite things about the class? What were your least favorite things?
My most favorite part was the inclass assignments, where we can collaborate with our group
mates, solve the problem, clarify our doubts and get a better understanding.
2. Favorite things the professor did or didn’t do?
My favorite thing about my professor is the way he kept the class interactive and try to engage
everyone and made sure that he helped everyone in getting the concept clear.
3. What would you change for next time?
Nothing

1. What were your favorite things about the class? What were your least favorite things?
a. Favorite things: Group Assignment, Research class, Flexible schedule for
assignment
b. Least favorite things: None
2. Favorite things the professor did or didn’t do?
a. Favorite things: Sharing his experience, patiently answer questions
b. Least favorite things: None
3. What would you change for next time?
a. None

---
1. My favorite things were the group-based activities and in-class discussions. I’m not
sure I can think of a least-favorite thing right now, except for the wording of the
assignments/quizzes (discussed in part 3).
2. I appreciated breaking up the lecture with activities/breaks.
3. The wording of the assignments, in-class activities, and quizzes was often very
awkward and difficult to understand exactly what was expected. Usually I was able to
get a good grade in spite of this, but it caused more confusion and stress than I would
have liked. I think just changing the wording to make it more clear would be sufficient.

---
1. What were your favorite things about the class? What were your
least favorite things?
I enjoyed participating in the in-class exercises. Being able to exchange
ideas and listen to feedback from my group has allowed me to expand my
knowledge of object-oriented programming design.
There were some modules that felt rushed. This might be hard to handle,
due to the limited class time available.
2. Favorite things the professor did or didn’t do?
Professor Nguyen is very knowledgeable and easy to approach. I found it
very easy to get a hold of him whenever I had any questions or doubts.
3. What would you change for next time?
Nothing much really. I found the class to be quite enjoyable.

---

1. Surprisingly, one of the things I liked was the group work. Talking through the
problems with other people was helpful. I also liked that the notes were provided so
I could focus on listening instead of writing.
2.
I liked all the examples used to apply the concepts. The in-class work was helpful
because it gave an opportunity to talk it through with my group and was a preview of
the homework and quiz. It helped me make sure I understood the concept before I
did it on an assignment. I also liked that the professor engaged with us and asked
questions instead of doing only lecture.
3.
I would make the text of what is on the board larger.

---
QUESTION 1:
Favorite:
- The way content is presented in class and the ability to discuss in class as the professor asks questions openly.
- The homework assignments relating to the content of the book is good.
- Group assignments helped with a small group that communicates well.
Least Favorite:
- [Personal preference] Towards end of the course, i found the content in Bloch's book more helpful and easier to understand. I wish I focused more on that
instead of Liskov's book.
- I would prefer to focus on Java instead of including python as well since the material is created for it. Its not a big problem but can sometimes be confusing
as not all content is for Python. However, some interesting things were discovered because of this so it might be a good thing to keep :D
QUESTION 2:
- The way content is presented in class and the ability to discuss in class as the professor asks questions openly.
QUESTION 3:
- I would focus more on the content in Bloch.

---

6.1.
What were your favorite things about the class? What were your least favorite
things?
I really enjoyed working in a group for the homework assignments. The in-class
activities also helped keep us engaged with the lecture.
6.2.
Favorite things the professor did or didn’t do?
I enjoyed how the professor worked through examples step by step and let the
students work through the problems with him. I do wish the notes were easier to
see on the board and that the notes were located all in one place.
6.3.
What would you change for next time?
I think that class notes should be located all in one document since the beginning
of the semester. Also, if possible, maybe allow some way for students to view the
class notes on their computers in real-time so it is easier for them to see?

1. What were your favorite and least aspects of this class? Favorite topics?
Favorite topic was type abstraction. Least favorite was inheritance.
2. Favorite things the professor did or didn’t do?
The professor emphasises teaching as well as self study better than most classes. It comes naturally.
3. What would you change for next time?
A better class room hah!


---
Favorite topics may be data encapsulation
I like that the professor was engaging
I would maybe have a better study guide.

----

1. This class felt very relevant to my other courses this semester, as I saw things we were learning 
here being explained in CS 330 and CS 321, which was cool because I already understood those 
topics (Hoare logic, for example) before they were addressed in those classes because of 419. 
2. I liked how the professor let us work in groups and made use of in class exercises, as well as 
weekly quizzes. I always like those because I feel like they help make sure we understand the 
material.
3. This isn’t the professor’s decision, but 3 hour classes like we had this semester are always 
difficult to sit through, at least for me.

---

1.
favorite aspects: I liked the challenge of the homeworks and working with the group and the
lectures were pretty interesting for certain aspects
least favorite aspect: sometimes the homework questions were pretty confusing and the in class
examples was not my favorite because my group members tended to show to class late
so i had no one to figure it out with and bounce ideas off of and there really wasnt much stress
to do them sometimes.

favorite topic: dont have any i liked most if not all of them except hoare logic which was very
difficult for me to understand
favorite things professor did: The lectures were easy to engage too. i liked that the professor
stayed behind after quizzes to make sure everything was fine
and was very reasonably for most if not all things in the class
favorite things professor didn't do: sometimes the notes were posted late and questions on
homework was sometimes confusing and maybe find another way to make everyone more
engaged in
the in class examples when students talk to each other the lecture part showing how it was
done was good tho just student to student part
2.what would i change next time?
i would make sure to read materials before doing the homework because what shouldve been
1-2 hours usually went to around 3-4 hours with our group trying to figure some stuff out
sometimes

---
The class was very interactive which made this course interesting and easier to understand through 
discussions
2. Favorite things the professor did or didn’t do? 
Had a very friendly relationship with all his students, making it easier to communicate with him
3. What would you change for next time? 
Feedback on assignments, so they can be gone over before exams. That'll make preparation easier 
and provide more clarity

---
1. The content was hard to grasb 
 
2. I liked the prof engaged with the class
 
3. have the class be less than 1:45 there is a lot of content to pack into one class

---

What were your favorite and least aspects of this class? Favorite topics? Favorite aspects was the teaching style and lectures covered.
2. Favorite things the professor did or didn’t do? Favorite things were that professor allowed students to work on problems then would go over answers. Very helpful when learning
3. What would you change for next time? I would add the in class solutions online so that there can be some availability to look back and see the answers. instead of just the questions

--- 
1. My favorite part of this is learning the LSP topic. I would also suggest to have a slide notes.
2. I would review the course material more often if i could change for next time.
And, thanks for professor, I really enjoy the course of learning, and get to know your research topic!

Spring 2022


1. What were your favorite and least aspects of this class? Favorite topics?
Favorite aspect: Not sure, this class was good in general
Least favorite: Waitlist
Favorite topic: bad things happening in Java, like equals contract, breaking immutability,
inheritance, etc.
2. Favorite things the professor did or didn’t do?
He is a good professor
3. What would you change for next time?
It is not a big deal, but sometimes I felt class notes uploaded by professor was sometimes
different from what he typed in class,
It would be good if we have recorded lectures
I would go over quizzes briefly especially the questions that people got wrong since we had a
lot of free class time. I'm sure many people don't bother to ask questions and just move on.
---

1. What were your favorite and least aspects of this class? Favorite topics?
As of now I like everything in the class
2.Favorite things the professor did or didn’t do?
Good at explaining the concepts
3.What would you change for next time?
I think this is good no changes are required.

---

What were your favorite
and
least aspects of this class? Favorite topics?

1.
I personally like in class assignments in which we can discuss with our group 

and can gain more knowledge. 

My favorite topic is Hoare logic. I didn’t know about this before this class.

Favorite things the professor did or didn’t do?

2.
He is good at providing notes in a different way. He explained everything in 

clear with notes.

What would you change for next time?

3.
Nothing. Everything is good

---

1. What were your favourite and least aspects of this class? Favourite topics?
Answer:
I liked that class was very interactive.
I felt that every project is a group project and would like to do some individual
assignments too.
Some of my favourite topics are Imperative Program Verification , Junit and
Generics.
2. Favourite things the professor did or didn’t do?
Answer:
Professor did collaborative learning with groups which made me learn how to
communicate and collaborate with groups by doing In Class exercises and
Assignments.
3. What would you change for next time?
Answer:
I would like to give some individual assignments. Would like to give less
assignments.

---

1. What were your favorite and least aspects of this class? Favorite topics?
My favorite aspect was all the content from the Bloch book. All of his lessons and items were
particularly insightful for modern Java software construction. My least favorite topic was Hoare
logic, and my favorite topic was Classes and Inheritance, given that the Java language has such
interesting constructs within this area.
2. Favorite things the professor did or didn’t do?
I thought the group work directly following the lectures was a good way to have the material
really sink in and gain the knowledge necessary to implement it.
3. What would you change for next time?
Having reading reflections before lectures was helpful, but the lectures primarily consisted of
reiterating the same content and examples from the book. It would have been more beneficial if
the lectures built off the reading by focusing on different and potentially more challenging
examples to supplement what we read.
---

1. What were your favorite and least aspects of this class? Favorite topics?
My favorite aspect of the class was the course structure and dividing the syllabus into reading
reflections, in-class assignments, quizzes every week and homework assignments which allowed a
broader understanding of the course. My favorite topic was Liskov’s Substitution Principle,
2. Favorite things the professor did or didn’t do?
Weekly quizzes and detailed explanation of all the concepts.
3. What would you change for next time?
It would be great if we had lesser number of assignments which are more elaborate individually,
rather than having to submit an assignment every week.

---
1. What were your favorite and least aspects of this class? Favorite topics?
I like the way the class is now.
2.
Favorite things the professor did or didn’t do?
Good at explaning the materials.
3. What would you change for next time?
I would not change anything

---
1. My favorite thing in the class was the in-class exercises. It’s always more effective for
me to discuss and learn in a group than the traditional teaching style. Favorite topic was
the contracts/specifications. The concept is so fundamental, but it was something I did
not learn about in my previous classes.
2. The reading reflections was a very good concept. It made us keep reading the textbook
every week, so we were well versed with what we’ve learned so far. If there were no
reflections, we wouldn’t have read the textbook completely.
3. Nothing, this class was very good
---

1. What were your favorite and least aspects of this class? Favorite topics?
Favorite topics: specifications and contracts, understanding oops in more depth.
2.
Favorite things the professor did or didn’t do? 3. What would you change for next time?
One of the favorite things is flexibility, professor gave us enough opportunities to get the thing right and
always helped us on piazza.
---

1. What were your favorite and least aspects of this class? Favorite
topics?
The most interesting topics were pre/postconditions, contracts, rep
invariants, Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP),Generics, mutable to
immutable.
2. Favorite things the professor did or didn’t do?
Professor did explain the concepts with multiple examples which is the
reason behind I could complete the assignment and reading reflections
were very useful.
all the concepts in the final exam were very similar to topics discussed in
class and in the assignment
3. What would you change for next time?
nothing.
---

1. What were your favorite and least aspects of this class? Favorite topics?
Answer: Favorite topic: Hoare Logic
Least topic: Junit
2. Favorite things the professor did or didn’t do?
Answer: The in class activities conducted by the professor were my favorite things in
the whole semester classes.
3. What would you change for next time?
Answer: Nothing till now it was a fun class and will help a lot in the future. Even the TA
helped a lot in clearing out doubts
---
1. What were your favorite and least aspects of this class? Favorite topics?
This class being offered in-person this semester was the best. It helps understand
better and interact with other classmates to learn from each other.
2. Favorite things the professor did or didn’t do?
The group exercises at the end of each class and going over them was very helpful
to understand some of the concepts taught in class. The way the class was divided
was great. There was no time to feel bored
3. What would you change for next time?
Nothing. Loved the class, professor, classmates, and even the building where we
had the class was super nice.
---
1. What were your favorite and least aspects of this class? Favorite topics?
The favorite part was Hoare logic. There was no least favorite part.

2. Favorite things the professor did or didn’t do?
The Professor gave enough time for us to discuss/understand the InClass exercises and came up
to our table to answer and clarify specific questions we had for that exercise.

3. What would you change for next time?
The only thing I’d change is that I’d like to have the in-person lecture first and then go home and
read the whole chapter. This will save a lot of time for the students since they’ll focus more on
the most important topics rather than trying to understand all the concepts themselves first and
then attending the in-person lecture (I think this is the norm in the USA’s university education
system which is the reverse of what we had in India. It took a lot of time for me to adjust to this).
Almost everytime, it was only after Professor’s in-person lecture that I felt confident in a
particular topic

---
1. What were your favorite and least aspects of this class? Favorite topics?
It is a detailed information driven subject for Oops and least would be its two much to grasp.
Favorite topic would be Hoare logic, Automation testing
2. Favorite things the professor did or didn’t do?
I like the way the in class exercise discussed after giving us all the time to do it first and
discuss all those readings that we did.
One thing I feel that could be done is to have a interactive quiz session among teams that
would make class more interactive.
3. What would you change for next time?
There is nothing as such to change but still there is few things which could be tried to make
class more interactive.

---
a. Favorite aspect was the formatting of the lectures, least favorite was having to
work in groups as the work required seemed feasible to do alone. Favorite topic
was Hoare logic.
b. I liked that the professor included many examples to explain a topic.
c. Perhaps add the option to work on homework individually
---

What were your favorite and least aspects of this class? Favorite topics?
I felt that generics were my favorite topic from the class as I learned a lot of new things I felt I
will be reliably using in the job field. My least favorite topic were Lambdas as they still confuse
me a good bit as well as some stuff revolving around abstract classes and interfaces.
2)
Favorite things the professor did or didn’t do?
I’m glad we took the extra class to review and talk about Hoare logic as it really helped me
better understand the subject. I really wish we had more examples of abstract classes,
interfaces, & lambdas to discus and work on in class as that was confusing topic for me.
3) What would you change for next time?
The class felt well structured but the topics from the beginning of the class (i.e.
mutability/immutability) weren’t really relevant outside of the few classes we spent on them. It
may be helpful to tie in this topic with the later material say generics or junit theories to getter
better understanding on how all this ties together

---
6.1
I enjoyed the general structure of the class, with the readings preparing us for class and the quizzes to test our knowledge. Though this was
only a small portion, I enjoyed the part
of class when we talked about Exceptions/Errors in Java briefly because I'm currently studying for the Java 8 OCA exam, which I've been doing
for the most part without a formal class
(though I learned a lot about Java in undergrad, and I'm continuing to learn more in my job).
6.2
The professor seemed very reasonable, and I appreciated that he was able to make himself available on Piazza or in his office hours.
Same with the TA.
Thank you both for a good semester :)
6.3
One thing I would change is to do a little more on JUnit theories, since we only touched on it for one class, and did not have any homework or
quizzes related to it to test our knowledge.
Especially since it was on the final exam, because that was the part I felt least comfortable with my answers for

---
1. Favorite aspects – lots of examples in class, straightforward class structure
Least favorite aspects – lack of formalized/organized notes
Favorite topics – all the same to me
2.
Favorite things professor did – lots of in class exercises, time to work on practice problems in
class and go over them
3.
I would definitely have some organized notes for the class (PDF, PowerPoint, etc) instead of
typing them on the screen as we go over material in class. I feel like that would really help
students focus on the core concepts of the class and avoid any issues like with formatting during
class. Sometimes the typed notes got hard to read, especially when they got translated to html
on the class website.

---
1. I liked the way sessions went. Class exercises are my favorite.
2. Engaging and giving time to understand the exercises are my favorites
3. It’s good the way currently it is.

---
1. What were your favorite and least aspects of this class? Favorite topics?
The Hoare logic was something I really enjoyed. There wasn’t really a topic that I disliked though.
2. Favorite things the professor did or didn’t do?
Reviewing the in class examples was helpful and being able to work in groups for the assignments was
useful. The group work was especially helpful with one or two of the homeworks where I had one
approach but Karen had another and we balanced each other out.
3. What would you change for next time?;o n
Honestly, I really enjoyed this class. I work as a software engineer and most of the course is relatable to
my day-to-day tasks. There isn’t anything I can think of to change. Using Discord for the group
assignments was super helpful and sharing the files between each other on One Drive was a good choice
as well.
---


1. What were your favorite and least aspects of this class? Favorite Topics?
a) I liked the partial flipped teaching style. The format for reading & reflections was a good
introduction to the material, then lecture focused on what was important.
b) I REALLY liked it when the next lecture would re-address some of the material from the
previous lecture. The best example of this was going over the Hoare logic home work after
it was submitted.
2. Favorite things the professor did or didn’t do?
a) The cadence of the class was consistent, each week was a new topic (with the exception of
Hoare logic which covered two weeks) and there was a corresponding quiz after each
weeks’ material, I’m not a huge fan of quizzes but in this class it really worked better than
one or two Mid-terms.
b) Thought the extended time limit on quizzes was appreciated, I think there were cases where
that was abused. In the future it is probably better to:
i. Make it a requirement to be in class to take the quiz,
ii. If a student can’t be there for the quiz then they have to take the make-up quiz,
iii. Make students submit before the professor leaves.
3. What would you change for next time?
a) Make the Reflections due on Sunday night, and THEN have some formal Power point slides
or PDF examples which can be made available right after submission to allow the students
to focus in on material that is critical for the lecture. This isn’t that important but it might
help as some of the details in the reading didn’t be come clear until I saw more examples.
Perhaps that is just a matter of more time.
b) Go over homework in the beginning of the class after it was due. Make presenting the code
from a random group a part of the grade. Or to incentive students to present, they have their
presentation be a replacement for that days quiz. “Present and you don’t have to take the
quiz.” Though the quizzes really helped as well.
c) I really can’t believe I’m saying this, but the quizzes actually helped in my learning process.
Granted I would review last weeks material in the 1-2 hours before class started, but perhaps
knowing there was a quiz forced me to do weekly reviewing

---

a. Favorite aspect was the formatting of the lectures, least favorite was having to
work in groups as the work required seemed feasible to do alone. Favorite topic
was Hoare logic.
b. I liked that the professor included many examples to explain a topic.
c. Perhaps add the option to work on homework individually.

---
1. What were your favorite and least aspects of this class? Favorite topics?
Most favorite was the topic on Generics and all the items suggested by Bloch. Least favorite is Hoare Logic, It seems this technique is
outdated and maybe it should be taught with tools available to run the Hoare Logic rather than performing it manually.
2. Favorite things the professor did or didn’t do?
The In Class Assignments help us prepare for the team work for the home Assignments and also learn from other members of the team.
3. What would you change for next time?
I would like the Junit Chapter to be in the intial or begining of the class, because a lot of course assignments are dependent on it. There is
as assumption that most of the students know how to use JUnit

Fall 2021

---
1.	What were your favorite and least aspects of this class? Favorite topics?
Ans:
The concept of pre and post-condition, mutability, the different takes on topics by Bloch and Liskov, LSP, and many more.
2.	Favorite things the professor did or didn’t do? 
Ans:
I liked how the professor went about explain things- sometimes from technical to abstract implementation and at times from abstract to technical. 
I think it would have helped if you had shared some of your general notes on the topics we went through in the class.
3.	What would you change for next time?
Ans:
Not much. But I think towards the beginning of the semester, having quiz at the end of the class distracted my focus from the class discussion. So maybe have quiz available before or after class.

---

1. What were your favorite and least aspects of this class? Favorite topics?
	Favorite aspect of the class was the structure. Having lectures and in-class assignments paired with reading and homework assignments gave great coverage for learning and application both in and outside of class.
	Class materials were sometimes convoluted; it was difficult to decipher at first the acceptable file submission types. Material was often written in an unclear way or with typos. It was sometimes hard to find files; It wasn’t clear on the final that the file names linked to code at first.
	Favorite topics were Lambdas and Generics; very useful tools to streamline programming and taught well.
2. Favorite things the professor did or didn’t do?
	ThanhVu bringing up his own research and relating concepts from class to his work, particularly in regards to testing, was nice to see how content from class can be applied practically.
3. What would you change for next time?
	We didn’t have a mid-semester recap; it would have been nice to refresh on the materials learned so far.


---

1. I liked that this class was online but it also made some of the material harder to understand. 
   I like the group work (though it is always challenging to schedule). I found it helpful to discuss the concepts with my group.
   Having the quiz at the end of class was very helpful; It gave us a chance to get refocused on the course and the material.
   I work full time so comign straight off of afternoon meetings to a quiz would have been challenging.
2. I like that you added a lecture on Hoare Logic.
3. I felt our team wasn't always prepared to start the in class exercises. I like when we would have
   some lecture/review prior to jumping in.


---

1. What were your favorite and least aspects of this class? Favorite topics?
		my favorite part of the class was the inclass examples they made it easy to understand concepts
			my least favorite part of the class was A) having it be in such a long time block
			B) the context switching of vocabulary between the books and the professor teaching, it made me really confused at some point. 
	
2. Favorite things the professor did or didn’t do?

	i loved learning about the professors research topic and being able to talk to the professor openly
3. What would you change for next time?
	change the lenth of time a class was, because it was online it was very difficult to sit through the full length of time without being in a classroom. 

---
1. Favorite: Program Verification; Least: mutable and immutable.
2. Presenting many in-class exercises is really benefit for me to do practice. 3. Do more practice.

---
1. What were your favourite and least aspects of this class? Favourite topics? Great working loved the course, invariants and reasoning.
2. Favorite things the professor did or didn’t do? He’s so supportive
3. What would you change for next time? Nothing.

---
1. What were your favorite and least aspects of this class? Favorite topics? Favorite : Junit testing , least favorite: equal overriding
2. Favorite things the professor did or didn’t do? Favorit Hoar logic 3. What would you change for next time? Provide slides



---
Least favorite topic was Generics because it was most difficult, but I found it very useful. Hoare logic was second least favorite.
Favorite was contract writing
I felt we could have reviewed the quizzes the following week to go over correct answers. The comments in the grades of quizzes were not very useful.


---
What were your favorite and least aspects of this class? Favorite topics?
- Favorite: Reading Reflections, because I like to write.
- Least Favorite: Manual Hoare Logic (extremely tedious). This may be something an
animation would help to teach better, and reduce the amount of time spent on it.
Question 7.2: Favorite things the professor did or didn’t do?
- No rush on quizzes, etc. No matter how well I do on assignments, or anything non-timed, I always freeze up under time pressure. This has cost me so many points over the years that I would not want to count. The longer time limits here reduces stress, which enables one to more clearly think about and articulate answers.
- The TA was quite helpful. This was the first class where someone asked why I did not submit a quiz (hit save, instead of submit).
Question 7.3: What would you change for next time?
- I think that more topics could be covered, if less of the semester was spent fixated on a few topics, such as equals() / hashCode(). In particular, I think clone() is a relic of the past, which could be summarized as “Don’t Use This”.
- Other aspects of object oriented design could be covered, such as design patterns.
- A more explicit and direct introduction to SOLID.
- The MapPoly example should be replaced. I believe the concepts would be clearer, if
they were introduced using more simplistic examples. For example, the professor’s class
Dog example for covariance/contravariance was a good example.
- From life experience, more emphasis should be given to teaching interfaces, and why they are useful. equals() and hashCode() are going to get auto-generated most of the
time. On the other hand, it is surprising how many developers seem to avoid interfaces,
and detest composition over inheritance.
- I would add an assignment on using Coverity or some other static analysis tool.
- I am not sure what would be the best approach exactly, but I would put far more
emphasis on the fact that these principles can be applied to other languages as well. This class is not really a “learn Java” class. Rather, this is a “learn good OOP principles” class, but comes off as being a little too Java centric.
All that said, this was my favorite class this semester. Way back in 2010, I took CS 332 with Paul Ammann, which I would rank as one of the two most influential in the undergrad CS curriculum. This class seems very similar to my recollection of that class, but this class was more approachable and fun, which I would argue can make it more educational.

1.What were your favorite and least aspects of this class? Favorite topics? Hoare Logic sucked!!! It was so hard!
2. Favorite things the professor did or didn’t do?
  
I like that the professor gave us time during the class to work with partners and made most of our assignments and reading reflection group based. I worked really well with my team.

1. I think Junit was my least favorites since it's specific to Java.
Favorite topics? I really enjoyed the generics piece of the course.
2. Professor rocked he was super helpfully and responsive couldn’t ask for anything more.
3. I wish we would have covered reflection since this came up in my job recently and maybe touched on functional programming with lambda expressions.

1. What were your favorite and least aspects of this class? Favorite topics?
I enjoyed learning about pre and post conditions. I feel like this was a really valuable insight to programming and system architecture.
The Hoare logic was difficult to grasp, but I believe I finally got it.
2. Favorite things the professor did or didn’t do?
I appreciated that the professor regularly reviewed the homework and in-class exercises.
3. What would you change for next time?
I would do less group work. It allowed for some students to do less work overall. If they saw that another student in their group completed an assignment they wouldn’t attempt it themselves.

1. What were your favorite and least aspects of this class? Favorite topics?
I was glad to work within a group because most of the times my group members were able to explain or help with homework. My recommendation to new students is that, if you don’t have Computer science background, this class is too difficult for you.
2. Favorite things the professor did or didn’t do? 3. What would you change for next time?
I had hard time following the lectures. I think it would be easier if we had power point slides to follow along. It is easy to lose track of what the question is or the topic.

1. What were your favorite and least aspects of this class? Favorite topics?
My favorite aspect of the class were the weekly assignments as I felt they helped me practice the concepts we were learning and understand them better. My least favorite aspect was it being online as I would've preferred meeting in person with the class but the in-person section was already full. My favorite topic was learning about contracts and specifications. 
2. Favorite things the professor did or didn’t do?
I liked going over the weekly reading reflections at the beginning of each class but wished we could've gone over the quizzes more in depth.
3. What would you change for next time?
An in person class

1.      My favorite part about this class were the in-class exercises. Perhaps the least favorite were group hw assignments since it was difficult to find the right time for everybody to meet.  
2.      I thought the lectures were well organized and well-explained. I do not have complaints.  
3.      I would not change much for next time other than the group homework assignments.
